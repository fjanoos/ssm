	research is the acquisition of physiological and biochemical information
	non-invasively using the nuclear spins of the water molecules in
	the human body. In this trial, a recent and unique accomplishment
	was the introduction of the ability to map human brain function non-invasively.
	Today, functional images with subcentimetre resolution of the entire
	human brain can be generated in single subjects and in data acquisition
	times of several minutes using 1.5 tesla (T) MRI scanners that are
	often used in hospitals for clinical purposes. However, there have
	been accomplishments beyond this type of imaging using significantly
	higher magnetic fields such as 4 T. Efforts for developing high magnetic
	field human brain imaging and functional mapping using MRI (f{MRI})
	were undertaken at about the same time. It has been demonstrated
	that high magnetic fields result in improved contrast and, more importantly,
	in elevated sensitivity to capillary level changes coupled to neuronal
	activity in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast
	mechanism used in f{MRI}. These advantages have been used to generate,
	for example, high resolution functional maps of ocular dominance
	columns, retinotopy within the small lateral geniculate nucleus,
	true single-trial f{MRI} and early negative signal changes in the
	temporal evolution of the BOLD signal. So far these have not been
	duplicated or have been observed as significantly weaker effects
	at much lower field strengths. Some of these high-field advantages
	and accomplishments are reviewed in this paper.},

  abstract = {There is a growing consensus that the neuropsychological underpinnings
	of developmental dyscalculia (DD) are a genetically determined disorder
	of 'number sense', a term denoting the ability to represent and manipulate
	numerical magnitude nonverbally on an internal number line. However,
	this spatially-oriented number line develops during elementary school
	and requires additional cognitive components including working memory
	and number symbolization (language). Thus, there may be children
	with familial-genetic DD with deficits limited to number sense and
	others with DD and comorbidities such as language delay, dyslexia,
	or attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. This duality is supported
	by epidemiological data indicating that two-thirds of children with
	DD have comorbid conditions while one-third have pure DD. Clinically,
	they differ according to their profile of arithmetic difficulties.
	fMRI studies indicate that parietal areas (important for number functions),
	and frontal regions (dominant for executive working memory and attention
	functions), are under-activated in children with DD. A four-step
	developmental model that allows prediction of different pathways
	for DD is presented. The core-system representation of numerical
	magnitude (cardinality; step 1) provides the meaning of 'number',
	a precondition to acquiring linguistic (step 2), and Arabic (step
	3) number symbols, while a growing working memory enables neuroplastic
	development of an expanding mental number line during school years
	(step 4). Therapeutic and educational interventions can be drawn
	from this model.},

	However, information about functional interactions between brain

	applied vector autoregressive modeling in the context of Granger
	causality as a method to analyze directed connectivity in a standard
	event-related f{MRI} study using a simple auditory-motor paradigm.
	The basic idea is to use temporal information in stochastic time
	series of a brain region in order to predict signal time courses
	in other brain regions. Thus, we predicted that the method should
	demonstrate causal influence of the auditory cortex and the supplementary
	motor area (SMA) on primary motor cortex. Eleven right-handed healthy
	female subjects were instructed to press a ball with either their
	left or their right hand when hearing the command "left" or "right"
	in the scanner. Influence to the left motor cortex was found from
	bilateral auditory cortex as well as from the SMA in 9 of 11 subjects.
	Granger causality to the right motor cortex existed from bilateral
	auditory cortex in 5 and from SMA in 6 subjects. Granger causality
	to the SMA existed from right auditory cortex in 7 subjects and from
	left auditory cortex in 8 subjects. Our findings in a simple task
	show that even under suboptimal circumstances (a relatively long
	TR of 2440 ms), Granger causality can be a useful tool to explore
	effective connectivity. Temporally optimized scanning should increase
	that potential.},

	in the resting state, to estimate frequency-dependent correlation
	matrices characterizing functional connectivity between 90 cortical
	and subcortical regions. After thresholding the wavelet correlation
	matrices to create undirected graphs of brain functional networks,
	we found a small-world topology of sparse connections most salient
	in the low-frequency interval 0.03-0.06 Hz. Global mean path length
	(2.49) was approximately equivalent to a comparable random network,
	whereas clustering (0.53) was two times greater; similar parameters
	have been reported for the network of anatomical connections in the
	macaque cortex. The human functional network was dominated by a neocortical
	core of highly connected hubs and had an exponentially truncated
	power law degree distribution. Hubs included recently evolved regions
	of the heteromodal association cortex, with long-distance connections
	to other regions, and more cliquishly connected regions of the unimodal
	association and primary cortices; paralimbic and limbic regions were
	topologically more peripheral. The network was more resilient to
	targeted attack on its hubs than a comparable scale-free network,
	but about equally resilient to random error. We conclude that correlated,
	low-frequency oscillations in human f{MRI} data have a small-world
	architecture that probably reflects underlying anatomical connectivity
	of the cortex. Because the major hubs of this network are critical
	for cognition, its slow dynamics could provide a physiological substrate

  abstract = {Networks have become a key approach to understanding systems of interacting
	objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological
	organisms and human society. One crucial step when studying the structure
	and dynamics of networks is to identify communities: groups of related
	nodes that correspond to functional subunits such as protein complexes
	or social spheres. Communities in networks often overlap such that
	nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks
	are known to possess hierarchical organization, where communities
	are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. However, the
	fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap,
	where each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the
	consequence that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships
	between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups
	of links rather than nodes and show that this unorthodox approach
	successfully reconciles the antagonistic organizing principles of
	overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to the existing
	literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link communities
	naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization.
	We find relevant link communities in many networks, including major
	biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and metabolic
	networks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically
	organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales
	while maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link
	communities are fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and
	hierarchical organization in networks to be two aspects of the same
	phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance images acquired with high temporal resolution often
	exhibit large noise artifacts, which arise from physiological sources
	as well as from the acquisition hardware. These artifacts can be
	detrimental to the quality and interpretation of the time-course
	data in functional {MRI} studies. A class of wavelet-domain de-noising
	algorithms estimates the underlying, noise-free signal by thresholding
	(or 'shrinking') the wavelet coefficients, assuming the underlying
	temporal noise of each pixel is uncorrelated and Gaussian. A Wiener-type
	shrinkage algorithm is developed in this paper, for de-noising either
	complex- or magnitude-valued image data sequences. Using the de-correlation
	properties of the wavelet transform, as elucidated by Johnstone and
	Silverman, the assumption of i.i.d. Gaussian noise can be abandoned,
	opening up the possibility of removing colored noise. Both wavelet-
	and wavelet-packet based algorithms are developed, and the Wiener
	method is compared to the traditional Hard and Soft wavelet thresholding
	methods of Donoho and Johnstone. The methods are applied to two types
	of data sets. In the first, an artificial set of complex-valued images
	was constructed, in which each pixel has a simulated bimodal time-course.
	Gaussian noise was added to each of the real and imaginary channels,
	and the noise removed from the complex image sequence as well as
	the magnitude image sequence (where the noise is Rician). The bias
	and variance between the original and restored paradigms was estimated
	for each method. It was found that the Wiener method gives better
	balance in bias and variance than either Hard or Soft methods. Furthermore,
	de-noising magnitude data provides comparable accuracy of the restored
	images to that obtained from de-noising complex data. In the second
	data set, an actual in vivo complex image sequence containing unknown
	physiological and instrumental noise was used. The same bimodal paradigm
	as in the first data set was added to pixels in a small localized
	region of interest. For the paradigm investigated here, the smooth
	Daubechies wavelets provide better de-noising characteristics than
	the discontinuous Haar wavelets. Also, it was found that wavelet
	packet de-noising offers no significant improvement over the computationally
	more efficient wavelet de-noising methods. For the in vivo data,
	it is desirable that the groups of "activated" time-courses are homogeneous.
	It was found that the internal homogeneity of the group of time-courses
	increases when de-noising is applied. This suggests using de-noising
	as a pre-processing tool for both exploratory and inferential data
	analysis methods in f{MRI}.},

  abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (f{MRI}) based on blood oxygenation
	level dependent (BOLD) signal changes is a sensitive tool for mapping
	brain activation, but quantitative interpretation of the BOLD response
	is problematic. The BOLD response is primarily driven by cerebral
	blood flow (CBF) changes, but is moderated by M, a scaling parameter
	reflecting baseline deoxyhemoglobin, and n, the ratio of fractional
	changes in CBF to cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO(2)).
	We compared M and n between cortical (visual cortex, VC) and subcortical
	(lentiform nuclei, LN) regions using a quantitative approach based
	on calibrating the BOLD response with a hypercapnia experiment. Although
	M was similar in both regions (~5.8\%), differences in n (2.21+/-0.03
	in VC and 1.58+/-0.03 in LN; Cohen d=1.71) produced substantially
	weaker (~3.7x) subcortical than cortical BOLD responses relative
	to CMRO(2) changes. Because of this strong sensitivity to n, BOLD
	response amplitudes cannot be interpreted as a quantitative reflection
	of underlying metabolic changes, particularly when comparing cortical
	and subcortical regions.},

  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of several structure-seeking
	multivariate statistical techniques, exploratory as well as inferential,
	that have been proposed recently for the characterization and detection
	of activation in both PET and f{MRI} time series data. In particular,
	PCA is data driven and does not assume that the neural or hemodynamic
	response reaches some steady state, nor does it involve correlation
	with any pre-defined or exogenous experimental design template. In
	this paper, we present a generalized linear systems framework for
	PCA based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) model for representation
	of spatio-temporal f{MRI} data sets. Statistical inference procedures
	for PCA, including point and interval estimation will be introduced
	without the constraint of explicit hypotheses about specific task-dependent
	effects. The principal eigenvectors capture both the spatial and
	temporal aspects of f{MRI} data in a progressive fashion; they are
	inherently matched to unique and uncorrelated features and are ranked
	in order of the amount of variance explained. PCA also acts as a
	variation reduction technique, relegating most of the random noise
	to the trailing components while collecting systematic structure
	into the leading ones. Features summarizing variability may not directly
	be those that are the most useful. Further analysis is facilitated
	through linear subspace methods involving PC rotation and strategies
	of projection pursuit utilizing a reduced, lower-dimensional natural
	basis representation that retains most of the information. These
	properties will be illustrated in the setting of dynamic time-series
	response data from f{MRI} experiments involving pharmacological stimulation
	of the dopaminergic nigro-striatal system in primates.},

	sampling matrix, by field inhomogeneities, at different object positions,
	i.e., a movement-by-inhomogeneity interaction. This has been addressed
	previously by using empirical field measurements. In the present
	paper we suggest a forward model of how data is affected by an inhomogeneous
	field at different object positions. From this model we derive a
	method to solve the inverse problem of estimating the field inhomogeneities
	and their derivatives with respect to object position, directly from
	the EPI data and estimated realignment parameters. The field is modeled
	as a linear combination of cosine basis fields, which facilitates
	a fast way of implementing the necessary matrix operations. Simulations
	suggest that the solution is tractable and that the fields are estimable
	given the deformed images and knowledge of the relative positions
	at which they have been acquired. An experiment on a subject performing
	voluntary movements in the scanner yielded plausible estimates of
	the deformation fields and their application to #unwarp# the time

	This leads to the notion that attention is associated with changes

	Three subjects were scanned under identical stimulus conditions (visual

	the PFC in our model as a 'modulator' of the pathway between V5 and

  abstract = {We review here a new approach to mapping the human cerebral cortex
	into distinct subdivisions. Unlike cytoarchitecture or traditional
	functional imaging, it does not rely on specific anatomical markers
	or functional hypotheses. Instead, we propose that the unique activity
	time course (ATC) of each cortical subdivision, elicited during natural
	conditions, acts as a temporal fingerprint that can be used to segregate
	cortical subdivisions, map their spatial extent, and reveal their
	functional and potentially anatomical connectivity. We argue that
	since the modular organisation of the brain and its connectivity
	evolved and developed in natural conditions, these are optimal for
	revealing its organisation. We review the concepts, methodology and
	first results of this approach, relying on data obtained with functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (f{MRI}) when volunteers viewed traditional
	stimuli or a James Bond movie. Independent component analysis (ICA)
	was used to identify voxels belonging to distinct functional subdivisions,
	based on their differential spatio-temporal fingerprints. Many more
	regions could be segregated during natural viewing, demonstrating
	that the complexity of natural stimuli leads to more differential
	responses in more functional modules. We demonstrate that, in a single
	experiment, a multitude of distinct regions can be identified across
	the whole brain, even within the visual cortex, including areas V1,
	V4 and V5. This differentiation is based entirely on the differential
	ATCs of different areas during natural viewing. Distinct areas can
	therefore be identified without any a priori hypothesis about their
	function or spatial location. The areas we identified corresponded
	anatomically across subjects, and their ATCs showed highly area-specific
	inter-subject correlations. Furthermore, natural conditions led to
	a significant de-correlation of interregional ATCs compared to rest,
	indicating an increase in regional specificity during natural conditions.
	In contrast, the correlation between ATCs of distant regions of known
	substantial anatomical connections increased and reflected their
	known anatomical connectivity pattern. We demonstrate this using
	the example of the language network involving Broca's and Wernicke's
	area and homologous areas in the two hemispheres. In conclusion,
	this new approach to brain mapping may not only serve to identify
	novel functional subdivisions, but to reveal their connectivity as
	well.},

	interpretation of f{MRI} measurements for basic neuroscience and
	clinical studies can be complicated by inter-subject and inter-session
	variability arising from modulation of the baseline vascular state
	by disease, aging, diet, and pharmacological agents. In particular,
	recent studies have shown that the temporal dynamics of the cerebral
	blood flow (CBF) and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
	responses to stimulus are modulated by changes in baseline CBF induced
	by various vasoactive agents and by decreases in vascular compliance
	associated with aging. These effects are not readily explained using
	current models of the CBF and BOLD responses. We present here a second-order
	nonlinear feedback model of the evoked CBF response in which neural
	activity modulates the compliance of arteriolar smooth muscle. Within
	this model framework, the baseline vascular state affects the dynamic
	response by changing the relative contributions of an active smooth
	muscle component and a passive connective tissue component to the
	overall vessel compliance. Baseline dependencies of the BOLD signal
	are studied by coupling the arteriolar compliance model with a previously

	to quantify the stability of such resting-state networks (RSNs),
	which was implemented with k-means clustering. The core of the method
	consists in bootstrapping the available datasets to replicate the
	clustering process a large number of times and quantify the stable
	features across all replications. This bootstrap analysis of stable
	clusters (BASC) has several benefits: (1) it can be implemented in
	a multi-level fashion to investigate stable RSNs at the level of
	individual subjects and at the level of a group; (2) it provides
	a principled measure of RSN stability; and (3) the maximization of
	the stability measure can be used as a natural criterion to select
	the number of RSNs. A simulation study validated the good performance
	of the multi-level BASC on purely synthetic data. Stable networks
	were also derived from a real resting-state study for 43 subjects.
	At the group level, seven RSNs were identified which exhibited a
	good agreement with the previous findings from the literature. The
	comparison between the individual and group-level stability maps
	demonstrated the capacity of BASC to establish successful correspondences
	between these two levels of analysis and at the same time retain
	some interesting subject-specific characteristics, e.g. the specific
	involvement of subcortical regions in the visual and fronto-parietal

  abstract = {A state-space modeling approach for examining dynamic relationship

	(Ho, M.R., Ombao, H., Shumway, R., 2005. A State-Space Approach to
	Modelling Brain Dynamics to Appear in Statistica Sinica). Their approach
	assumed that the quantity representing the influence of one neuronal
	system over another, or effective connectivity, is time-invariant.
	However, more and more empirical evidence suggests that the connectivity
	between brain areas may be dynamic which calls for temporal modeling
	of effective connectivity. A Bayesian approach is proposed to solve
	this problem in this paper. Our approach first decomposes the observed
	time series into measurement error and the BOLD (blood oxygenation
	level-dependent) signals. To capture the complexities of the dynamic
	processes in the brain, region-specific activations are subsequently
	modeled, as a linear function of the BOLD signals history at other
	brain regions. The coefficients in these linear functions represent
	effective connectivity between the regions under consideration. They
	are further assumed to follow a random walk process so to characterize
	the dynamic nature of brain connectivity. We also consider the temporal
	dependence that may be present in the measurement errors. ML-II method
	(Berger, J.O., 1985. Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis
	(2nd ed.). Springer, New York) was employed to estimate the hyperparameters

	models. Statistical inference of the effective connectivity coefficients
	was based on their posterior distributions and the corresponding
	Bayesian credible regions (Carlin, B.P., Louis, T.A., 2000. Bayes
	and Empirical Bayes Methods for Data Analysis (2nd ed.). Chapman

  abstract = {Functional neuroimaging has emerged as an important approach to study
	the brain and the mind. Surprisingly, although they are based on
	radically different physical approaches both positron emission tomography
	(PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) make brain activation
	imaging possible through measurements involving water molecules.
	So far, PET and MRI functional imaging have relied on the principle
	that neuronal activation and blood flow are coupled through metabolism.
	However, a new paradigm has emerged to look at brain activity through
	the observation with MRI of the molecular diffusion of water. In
	contrast with the former approaches diffusion MRI has the potential
	to reveal changes in the intrinsic water physical properties during
	brain activation, which could be more intimately linked to the neuronal
	activation mechanisms and lead to an improved spatial and temporal
	resolution. However, this link has yet to be fully confirmed and
	understood. To shed light on the possible relationship between water
	and brain activation, this introductory paper reviews the most recent
	data on the physical properties of water and on the status of water
	in biological tissues, and evaluates their relevance to brain diffusion
	MRI. The biophysical mechanisms of brain activation are then reassessed
	to reveal their intimacy with the physical properties of water, which
	may come to be regarded as the 'molecule of the mind'.},

  abstract = {People can discriminate real words from nonwords even when the latter
	are orthographically and phonologically word-like, presumably because
	words activate specific lexical and/or semantic information. We investigated
	the neural correlates of this identification process using event-related
	functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants performed
	a visual lexical decision task under conditions that encouraged specific
	word identification: Nonwords were matched to words on orthographic
	and phonologic characteristics, and accuracy was emphasized over
	speed. To identify neural responses associated with activation of
	nonsemantic lexical information, processing of words and nonwords
	with many lexical neighbors was contrasted with processing of items
	with no neighbors. The fMRI data showed robust differences in activation
	by words and word-like nonwords, with stronger word activation occurring
	in a distributed, left hemisphere network previously associated with
	semantic processing, and stronger nonword activation occurring in
	a posterior inferior frontal area previously associated with grapheme-to-phoneme
	mapping. Contrary to lexicon-based models of word recognition, there
	were no brain areas in which activation increased with neighborhood
	size. For words, activation in the left prefrontal, angular gyrus,
	and ventrolateral temporal areas was stronger for items without neighbors,
	probably because accurate responses to these items were more dependent
	on activation of semantic information. The results show neural correlates
	of access to specific word information. The absence of facilitatory
	lexical neighborhood effects on activation in these brain regions
	argues for an interpretation in terms of semantic access. Because
	subjects performed the same task throughout, the results are unlikely
	to be due to task-specific attentional, strategic, or expectancy
	effects.},

  abstract = {{The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning
	over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments
	in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian
	methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream,
	while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing
	and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability
	of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development
	of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational
	Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels
	have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications.
	This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while
	providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition
	and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year
	PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous
	knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is
	assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear
	algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities
	would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained
	introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for
	courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal
	processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive
	support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400
	exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for
	a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while
	solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the
	publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material,
	and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest
	information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical
	aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include
	free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example
	data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant
	Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair
	in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow
	of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the
	Royal Acad.~ Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural
	Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.}},

  abstract = {Data obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging are often
	limited by a low signal-to-noise ratio. The time-course data obtained
	from activated regions contain both system noise and physiological
	noise, primarily linked to the heart and respiratory rates, that
	are superimposed on task induced signals. Time averaging of a practical
	number of data sets is not very effective in improving the signal-to-noise
	ratio because neither system nor physiological noise is truly random.
	In this paper, a method is presented for filtering unwanted physiological
	fluctuations, including aliased signals that are formed as a result
	of long repetition time (TR) values. A pulse oximeter was used to
	obtain cardiac and respiratory information during the scanning period.
	Finite impulse response band-reject digital filters were designed
	to remove the physiological fluctuations. For comparison, cross-correlation
	analyses were performed at the same level of statistical significance
	on both filtered and unfiltered data. We demonstrate that this method
	can improve the detection of weak signals without increasing the
	probability of false positives.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to separate multiple signal
	components present in functional MRI (f{MRI}) data sets. Blind source
	separation techniques were applied to the analysis of f{MRI} data
	to determine multiple physiologically relevant independent signal
	sources. METHOD: Computer simulations were performed to test the
	reliability and robustness of the independent component analysis
	(ICA). Four subjects (3 males and 1 female between 14 and 29 years
	old) were scanned under various stimulus conditions: (1) rest while
	breathing room air, (2) bilateral finger tapping while breathing
	room air, and (3) hypercapnia during bilateral finger tapping. RESULTS:
	Simulations performed on synthetic data sets demonstrated that not
	only could the algorithm reliably detect the shapes of each of the
	source signals, but it also preserved their relative amplitudes.
	The algorithm also performed robustly in the presence of noise. With
	use of f{MRI} time series data sets from bilateral finger tapping
	during hypercapnia, distinct physiologically relevant independent
	sources were reliably estimated. One independent component corresponded
	to the hypercapnic cerebrovascular response, and another independent
	component corresponded to cortical activation from bilateral finger
	tapping. In three of the four subjects, the underlying fluctuations
	in signal related to baseline respiratory rate were identified in
	the third independent component. Principal component analysis (PCA)
	could not separate these two independent physiological components.
	CONCLUSION: With use of ICA, signals originating from independent
	sources could be separated from a linear mixture of observed data.
	Limitations of PCA were also demonstrated.},

	rhyming in the lateral temporal cortex (LTC) and for spelling in
	the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)
	and fusiform gyrus were engaged by both tasks. Dynamic causal modeling
	showed that each task preferentially strengthened modulatory influences
	converging on its task-specific site (LTC for rhyming, IPS for spelling).
	These remarkably selective and symmetrical findings demonstrate that
	the nature of the behavioral task dynamically shifts the locus of
	integration (or convergence) to the network component specialized
	for that task. Furthermore, they suggest that the role of the task-selective
	areas is to provide a differential synthesis of incoming information
	rather than providing differential control signals influencing the
	activity of other network components. Our findings also showed that
	switching tasks led to changes in the target area influenced by the
	IFG, suggesting that the IFG may play a pivotal role in setting the
	cognitive context for each task. We propose that task-dependent shifts
	in effective connectivity are likely to be mediated through top-down
	modulations from the IFG to the task-selective regions in a way that
	differentially enhances their sensitivity to incoming word-form information.},

	its faster image acquisition, pMRI can in some cases even significantly

	are increasingly important but can be degraded by intensity non-uniformity.
	This non-uniformity can be more pronounced at higher field strengths,
	or when using multichannel receiver coils. We assessed the ability
	of the non-parametric non-uniform intensity normalization (N3) technique
	to correct non-uniformity in 72 volumetric brain MR scans from the
	preparatory phase of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
	(ADNI). Normal elderly subjects (n=18) were scanned on different
	3-T scanners with a multichannel phased array receiver coil at baseline,
	using magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) and spoiled
	gradient echo (SPGR) pulse sequences, and again 2 weeks later. When
	applying N3, we used five brain masks of varying accuracy and four
	spline smoothing distances (d=50, 100, 150 and 200 mm) to ascertain
	which combination of parameters optimally reduces the non-uniformity.
	We used the normalized white matter intensity variance (standard
	deviation/mean) to ascertain quantitatively the correction for a
	single scan; we used the variance of the normalized difference image
	to assess quantitatively the consistency of the correction over time
	from registered scan pairs. Our results showed statistically significant
	(p<0.01) improvement in uniformity for individual scans and reduction
	in the normalized difference image variance when using masks that
	identified distinct brain tissue classes, and when using smaller
	spline smoothing distances (e.g., 50-100 mm) for both MP-RAGE and
	SPGR pulse sequences. These optimized settings may assist future
	large-scale studies where 3-T scanners and phased array receiver
	coils are used, such as ADNI, so that intensity non-uniformity does
	not influence the power of MR imaging to detect disease progression

	to every pixel. A common constraint is that the labels should vary
	smoothly almost everywhere while preserving sharp discontinuities
	that may exist, e.g., at object boundaries. These tasks are naturally
	stated in terms of energy minimization. The authors consider a wide
	class of energies with various smoothness constraints. Global minimization
	of these energy functions is NP-hard even in the simplest discontinuity-preserving
	case. Therefore, our focus is on efficient approximation algorithms.
	We present two algorithms based on graph cuts that efficiently find
	a local minimum with respect to two types of large moves, namely
	expansion moves and swap moves. These moves can simultaneously change
	the labels of arbitrarily large sets of pixels. In contrast, many
	standard algorithms (including simulated annealing) use small moves
	where only one pixel changes its label at a time. Our expansion algorithm
	finds a labeling within a known factor of the global minimum, while
	our swap algorithm handles more general energy functions. Both of
	these algorithms allow important cases of discontinuity preserving
	energies. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our
	approach for image restoration, stereo and motion. On real data with
	ground truth, we achieve 98 percent accuracy},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the problem of evaluating goodness-of-fit
	of a path analytic model to an interregional correlation matrix derived
	from functional magnetic resonance imaging (f{MRI}) data. We argue
	that model evaluation based on testing the null hypothesis that the
	correlation matrix predicted by the model equals the population correlation
	matrix is problematic because P values are conditional on asymptotic
	distributional results (which may not be valid for f{MRI} data acquired
	in less than 10 min), as well as arbitrary specification of residual
	variances and effective degrees of freedom in each regional f{MRI}
	time series. We introduce an alternative approach based on an algorithm
	for automatic identification of the best fitting model that can be
	found to account for the data. The algorithm starts from the null
	model, in which all path coefficients are zero, and iteratively unconstrains
	the coefficient which has the largest Lagrangian multiplier at each
	step until a model is identified which has maximum goodness by a
	parsimonious fit index. Repeating this process after bootstrapping
	the data generates a confidence interval for goodness-of-fit of the
	best model. If the goodness of the theoretically preferred model
	is within this confidence interval we can empirically say that the
	theoretical model could be the best model. This relativistic and
	data-based strategy for model evaluation is illustrated by analysis
	of functional MR images acquired from 20 normal volunteers during
	periodic performance (for 5 min) of a task demanding semantic decision
	and subvocal rehearsal. A model including unidirectional connections
	from frontal to parietal cortex, designed to represent sequential
	engagement of rehearsal and monitoring components of the articulatory
	loop, is found to be irrefutable by hypothesis-testing and within
	confidence limits for the best model that could be fitted to the

	of citizenship in a numerate society. How these skills are acquired,
	or fail to be acquired, is of great importance not only to individual
	children but to the organisation of formal education and its role
	in society. METHOD: The evidence on the normal and abnormal developmental
	progression of arithmetical abilities is reviewed; in particular,
	evidence for arithmetical ability arising from innate specific cognitive
	skills (innate numerosity) vs. general cognitive abilities (the Piagetian
	view) is compared. RESULTS: These include evidence from infancy research,
	neuropsychological studies of developmental dyscalculia, neuroimaging
	and genetics. The development of arithmetical abilities can be described
	in terms of the idea of numerosity -- the number of objects in a
	set. Early arithmetic is usually thought of as the effects on numerosity
	of operations on sets such as set union. The child's concept of numerosity
	appears to be innate, as infants, even in the first week of life,
	seem to discriminate visual arrays on the basis of numerosity. Development
	can be seen in terms of an increasingly sophisticated understanding
	of numerosity and its implications, and in increasing skill in manipulating
	numerosities. The impairment in the capacity to learn arithmetic
	-- dyscalculia -- can be interpreted in many cases as a deficit in
	the concept in the child's concept of numerosity. The neuroanatomical
	bases of arithmetical development and other outstanding issues are
	discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence broadly supports the idea of
	an innate specific capacity for acquiring arithmetical skills, but
	the effects of the content of learning, and the timing of learning
	in the course of development, requires further investigation.},

  abstract = {The properties of the hemodynamic latencies in functional maps have
	been relatively unexplored. Accurate methods of estimating hemodynamic
	latencies are needed to take advantage of this feature of f{MRI}.
	A fully automated, weighted least-squares (WLS) method for estimating
	temporal latencies is reported. Using a weighted linear model, the
	optimal latency and amplitude of the f{MRI} response can be determined
	for those voxels that pass a detection threshold. There is evidence
	from previous studies that the hemodynamic response may be time-locked
	to the stimulus within certain limits, less variable earlier in its
	evolution, and able to resolve information about relative hemodynamic
	timing. This information can be used to test hypotheses about the
	sequence and spatial distribution of neural activity. The method
	can be used to weight the earliest evolution of the hemodynamic response
	more heavily and decrease bias resulting from the hemodynamic response
	function. Additionally, the WLS method can control for varying response
	shapes across the brain and improve latency comparisons between brain
	regions. The WLS method was developed to study the properties of
	hemodynamic latencies, which may be increasingly important as event-related
	f{MRI} continues to be advanced.},

	to separate data into maximally independent groups. Achieving maximal
	independence in space or time yields two varieties of ICA meaningful
	for functional {MRI} (f{MRI}) applications: spatial ICA (SICA) and
	temporal ICA (TICA). SICA has so far dominated the application of
	ICA to f{MRI}. The objective of these experiments was to study ICA
	with two predictable components present and evaluate the importance
	of the underlying independence assumption in the application of ICA.
	Four novel visual activation paradigms were designed, each consisting
	of two spatiotemporal components that were either spatially dependent,
	temporally dependent, both spatially and temporally dependent, or
	spatially and temporally uncorrelated, respectively. Simulated data
	were generated and f{MRI} data from six subjects were acquired using
	these paradigms. Data from each paradigm were analyzed with regression
	analysis in order to determine if the signal was occurring as expected.
	Spatial and temporal ICA were then applied to these data, with the
	general result that ICA found components only where expected, e.g.,
	S(T)ICA "failed" (i.e., yielded independent components unrelated
	to the "self-evident" components) for paradigms that were spatially
	(temporally) dependent, and "worked" otherwise. Regression analysis
	proved a useful "check" for these data, however strong hypotheses
	will not always be available, and a strength of ICA is that it can
	characterize data without making specific modeling assumptions. We
	report a careful examination of some of the assumptions behind ICA
	methodologies, provide examples of when applying ICA would provide
	difficult-to-interpret results, and offer suggestions for applying

	f{MRI} processing strategies utilize magnitude information and ignore
	the phase, resulting in an unnecessary loss of efficiency. As the
	optimum way to model the phase information is not clear, a flexible
	modeling technique is useful. To analyze complex data sets, independent

	ICA, the data are modeled as spatially independent components multiplied

	1) the time-courses can be complex-valued, 2) the images can be complex-valued,
	or 3) both the time-courses and the images can be complex-valued.
	These analytic approaches are applied to data from a visual stimulation
	paradigm, and results from three complex analysis models are presented

	the number of contiguous activated voxels at a given threshold, an

	(f{MRI}). A limitation of the standard f{MRI} ICA model is that a
	given component's time course is required to have the same delay
	at every voxel. As spatially varying delays (SVDs) may be found in
	f{MRI} data, using an ICA model with a fixed temporal delay for each
	source will have two implications. Larger SVDs can result in the
	splitting of regions with different delays into different components.
	Second, smaller SVDs can result in a biased ICA amplitude estimate

	approach for incorporating this prior temporal information and removing
	the limitation of a fixed source delay by performing ICA on the amplitude
	spectrum of the original f{MRI} data (thus removing latency information).
	A latency map is then estimated for each component using the resulting
	component images and the raw data. We show that voxels with similar
	time courses, but different delays, are grouped into the same component.
	Additionally, when using traditional ICA, the amplitudes of motor
	areas are diminished due to systematic delay differences between
	visual and motor areas. The amplitudes are more accurately estimated
	when using a latency-insensitive ICA approach. The resulting time
	courses, the component maps, and the latency maps may prove useful

	However, for some f{MRI} data analysis applications, such as for
	the analysis of an event-related paradigm, it would be useful to
	flexibly incorporate paradigm information into the ICA analysis.
	In this paper, we present an approach for constrained or semi-blind
	ICA (sbICA) analysis of event-related f{MRI} data by imposing regularization
	on certain estimated time courses using the paradigm information.
	We demonstrate the performance of our approach using both simulations
	and f{MRI} data from a three-stimulus auditory oddball paradigm.
	Simulation results suggest that (1) a regression approach slightly
	outperforms ICA when prior information is accurate and ICA outperforms
	the general linear model (GLM)-based approach when prior information
	is not completely accurate, (2) prior information improves the robustness
	of ICA in the presence of noise, and (3) ICA analysis using prior
	information with temporal constraints can outperform a regression
	approach when the prior information is not completely accurate. Using
	f{MRI} data, we compare a regression-based conjunction analysis of
	target and novel stimuli, both of which elicit an orienting response,
	to an sbICA approach utilizing both the target and novel stimuli
	to constrain the ICA time courses. Results show similar positive
	associations for both GLM and sbICA, but sbICA detects additional
	negative associates consistent with regions implicated in a default
	mode of brain activity. This suggests that task-related default mode
	decreases have a more "complex" signal that benefits from a flexible
	modeling approach. Compared with a traditional GLM approach, the
	sbICA approach provides a flexible way to analyze f{MRI}y data that
	reduces the assumptions placed upon the hemodynamic response of the
	brain. The advantages and limitations of our technique are discussed
	in detail in the manuscript to provide guidelines to the reader for
	developing useful applications. The use of prior time course information
	in a spatial ICA analysis, which combines elements of both a regression
	approach and a blind ICA approach, may prove to be a useful tool

	upon a general assumption of independence, allows the user to be

	is due to the use of only the nonderivative portion of the model

	testing an amplitude value that is a function of both the nonderivative
	and the derivative terms of the model. Using simulations, we show

	bias and that a model incorporating temporal derivatives is a more
	natural test for amplitude differences. The proposed test is applied

	We investigated these interactions by recording LFPs and single-unit

	and then used a unique probabilistic multivariate phase distribution
	to model the dependence of spike timing on the full pattern of proximal
	LFP phases, distal LFP phases, and LFP-LFP phase coupling between
	electrodes. Here we show that spiking activity in single neurons
	and neuronal ensembles depends on dynamic patterns of oscillatory
	phase coupling between multiple brain areas, in addition to the effects
	of proximal LFP phase. Neurons that prefer similar patterns of phase
	coupling exhibit similar changes in spike rates, whereas neurons
	with different preferences show divergent responses, providing a
	basic mechanism to bind different neurons together into coordinated

	situations the hemodynamic response function (HRF) can be reasonably
	characterized as the impulse response function of a linear and time
	invariant system. An accurate and robust extraction of the HRF is
	essential to infer quantitative information about the relative timing
	of the neuronal events in different brain regions. When no assumptions
	are made about the HRF shape, it is most commonly estimated using
	time windowed averaging or a least squares estimated general linear
	model based on either Fourier or delta basis functions. Recently,
	regularization methods have been employed to increase the estimation
	efficiency of the HRF; typically these methods produce more accurate
	HRF estimates than the least squares approach [Goutte, C., Nielsen,
	F.A., Hansen, L.K., 2000. Modeling the Haemodynamic Response in f{MRI}
	Using Smooth FIR Filters. IEEE Trans. Med. Imag. 19(12), 1188-1201.].
	Here, we use simulations to clarify the relative merit of temporal
	regularization based methods compared to the least squares methods
	with respect to the accuracy of estimating certain characteristics
	of the HRF such as time to peak (TTP), height (HR) and width (W)
	of the response. We implemented a Bayesian approach proposed by Marrelec

	parameter. The performance of both methods is compared with least
	square estimates as a function of temporal resolution, color and
	strength of the noise, and the type of stimulus sequences used. In
	almost all situations, under the considered assumptions (e.g. linearity,
	time invariance and smooth HRF), the regularization-based techniques
	more accurately characterize the HRF compared to the least-squares

	contrast has become one of the most useful neuroimaging techniques.
	It has been used extensively to study human brain function from sensory

	a voxel size of 3.1 x 3.1 x 5.0 mm3), which is incapable of mapping

	We demonstrate applications of high-resolution f{MRI} in studying
	the human visual pathway from the lateral geniculate nucleus in the

	Most results were obtained at very-high-magnetic fields (3.0 and

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Baum-Welch learning procedure for Hidden Markov Models
	(HMMs) provides a powerful tool for tailoring HMM topologies to data
	for use in knowledge discovery and clustering. A linear memory procedure
	recently proposed by Miklós, I. and Meyer, I.M. describes a memory
	sparse version of the Baum-Welch algorithm with modifications to
	the original probabilistic table topologies to make memory use independent
	of sequence length (and linearly dependent on state number). The
	original description of the technique has some errors that we amend.
	We then compare the corrected implementation on a variety of data
	sets with conventional and checkpointing implementations. RESULTS:
	We provide a correct recurrence relation for the emission parameter
	estimate and extend it to parameter estimates of the Normal distribution.
	To accelerate estimation of the prior state probabilities, and decrease
	memory use, we reverse the originally proposed forward sweep. We
	describe different scaling strategies necessary in all real implementations
	of the algorithm to prevent underflow. In this paper we also describe
	our approach to a linear memory implementation of the Viterbi decoding
	algorithm (with linearity in the sequence length, while memory use
	is approximately independent of state number). We demonstrate the
	use of the linear memory implementation on an extended Duration Hidden
	Markov Model (DHMM) and on an HMM with a spike detection topology.
	Comparing the various implementations of the Baum-Welch procedure
	we find that the checkpointing algorithm produces the best overall
	tradeoff between memory use and speed. In cases where sequence length
	is very large (for Baum-Welch), or state number is very large (for
	Viterbi), the linear memory methods outlined may offer some utility.
	CONCLUSION: Our performance-optimized Java implementations of Baum-Welch
	algorithm are available at http://logos.cs.uno.edu/~achurban. The
	described method and implementations will aid sequence alignment,
	gene structure prediction, HMM profile training, nanopore ionic flow
	blockades analysis and many other domains that require efficient
	HMM training with EM.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the estimation of the blood oxygen level-dependent
	response to a stimulus, as measured in functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (f{MRI}) data. A precise estimation is essential for a better
	understanding of cerebral activations. The most recent works have
	used a nonparametric framework for this estimation, considering each
	brain region as a system characterized by its impulse response, the
	so-called hemodynamic response function (HRF). However, the use of
	these techniques has remained limited since they are not well-adapted
	to real f{MRI}y data. Here, we develop a threefold extension to previous
	works. We consider asynchronous event-related paradigms, account
	for different trial types and integrate several f{MRI} sessions into
	the estimation. These generalizations are simultaneously addressed
	through a badly conditioned observation model. Bayesian formalism
	is used to model temporal prior information of the underlying physiological
	process of the brain hemodynamic response. By this way, the HRF estimate
	results from a tradeoff between information brought by the data and
	by our prior knowledge. This tradeoff is modeled with hyperparameters
	that are set to the maximum-likelihood estimate using an expectation
	conditional maximization algorithm. The proposed unsupervised approach
	is validated on both synthetic and real f{MRI} data, the latter originating
	from a speech perception experiment.},

	processing, adapted Fourier and wavelet analysis can be naturally
	lifted to the setting of digital data clouds, graphs, and manifolds.
	We use diffusion as a smoothing and scaling tool to enable coarse
	graining and multiscale analysis. Given a diffusion operator T on
	a manifold or a graph, with large powers of low rank, we present
	a general multiresolution construction for efficiently computing,
	representing and compressing Tt. This allows a direct multiscale
	computation, to high precision, of functions of the operator, notably
	the associated Green's function, in compressed form, and their fast
	application. Classes of operators for which these computations are
	fast include certain diffusion-like operators, in any dimension,
	on manifolds, graphs, and in non-homogeneous media. We use ideas
	related to the Fast Multipole Methods and to the wavelet analysis
	of Calderón-Zygmund and pseudo-differential operators, to numerically
	enforce the emergence of a natural hierarchical coarse graining of
	a manifold, graph or data set. For example for a body of text documents
	the construction leads to a directory structure at different levels
	of generalization. The dyadic powers of an operator can be used to
	induce a multiresolution analysis, as in classical Littlewood-Paley
	and wavelet theory: we construct, with efficient and stable algorithms,
	bases of orthonormal scaling functions and wavelets associated to
	this multiresolution analysis, together with the corresponding downsampling
	operators, and use them to compress the corresponding powers of the
	operator. While most of our discussion deals with symmetric operators
	and relates to localization to spectral bands, the symmetry of the
	operators and their spectral theory need not be considered, as the
	main assumption is reduction of the numerical ranks as we take powers

	cognitive task, functional connectivity mapped with MR imaging (fcMRI)
	shows regions with synchronous fluctuations of cerebral blood flow.
	When specific tasks are performed, functional MR imaging (f{MRI})
	can map locations in which regional cerebral blood flow increases
	synchronously with the performance of the task. We tested the hypothesis
	that fcMRI maps, based on the synchrony of low-frequency blood flow
	fluctuations, identify brain regions that show activation on f{MRI}
	maps of sensorimotor, visual, language, and auditory tasks. METHODS:
	In four volunteers, task-activation f{MRI} and functional connectivity
	(resting-state) fcMRI data were acquired. A small region of interest
	(in an area that showed maximal task activation) was chosen, and
	the correlation coefficient of the corresponding resting-state signal
	with the signal of all other voxels in the resting data set was calculated.
	The correlation coefficient was decomposed into frequency components
	and its distribution determined for each fcMRI map. The fcMRI maps
	were compared with the f{MRI} maps. RESULTS: For each task, fcMRI
	maps based on one to four seed voxel(s) produced clusters of voxels
	in regions of eloquent cortex. For each f{MRI} map a closely corresponding
	fcMRI map was obtained. The frequencies that predominated in the
	cross-correlation coefficients for the functionally related regions
	were below 0.1 Hz. CONCLUSION: Functionally related brain regions
	can be identified by means of their synchronous slow fluctuations
	in signal intensity. Such blood flow synchrony can be detected in
	sensorimotor areas, expressive and receptive language regions, and
	the visual cortex by fcMRI. Regions identified by the slow synchronous
	fluctuations are similar to those activated by motor, language, or
	visual tasks.},

  abstract = {Traditional (univariate) analysis of functional MRI (f{MRI}) data
	relies exclusively on the information contained in the time course
	of individual voxels. Multivariate analyses can take advantage of
	the information contained in activity patterns across space, from
	multiple voxels. Such analyses have the potential to greatly expand
	the amount of information extracted from f{MRI} data sets. In the
	present study, multivariate statistical pattern recognition methods,
	including linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines,
	were used to classify patterns of f{MRI} activation evoked by the
	visual presentation of various categories of objects. Classifiers
	were trained using data from voxels in predefined regions of interest
	during a subset of trials for each subject individually. Classification
	of subsequently collected f{MRI} data was attempted according to
	the similarity of activation patterns to prior training examples.
	Classification was done using only small amounts of data (20 s worth)
	at a time, so such a technique could, in principle, be used to extract
	information about a subject's percept on a near real-time basis.
	Classifiers trained on data acquired during one session were equally
	accurate in classifying data collected within the same session and
	across sessions separated by more than a week, in the same subject.
	Although the highest classification accuracies were obtained using
	patterns of activity including lower visual areas as input, classification
	accuracies well above chance were achieved using regions of interest
	restricted to higher-order object-selective visual areas. In contrast
	to typical f{MRI} data analysis, in which hours of data across many
	subjects are averaged to reveal slight differences in activation,
	the use of pattern recognition methods allows a subtle 10-way discrimination
	to be performed on an essentially trial-by-trial basis within individuals,
	demonstrating that f{MRI} data contain far more information than
	is typically appreciated.},

	functional magnetic resonance imaging (f{MRI}) may be greatly hindered
	by cardiac pulsatility artifacts. Vessel pulsation, cerebrospinal
	fluid movement, and tissue deformation are all associated with the
	cardiac cycle and all can produce f{MRI} signal variance. Most cognitive

	in part because of the lack of information on the regional significance
	and magnitude of cardiac-related signal variance in the brain. In
	this paper we present a topographical description of the regions

	The results are highly consistent across subjects and suggest that
	reduced sensitivity due to cardiac-induced noise in the BOLD signal

	blood vessels. Significant effects of cardiac-related variability

	the neuronal baseline activity of the brain, representing the state
	of the human brain in the absence of goal-directed neuronal action
	and external input, and that these slow fluctuations correspond to
	functionally relevant resting-state networks. Several studies on
	resting f{MRI} have been conducted, reporting an apparent similarity
	between the identified patterns. The spatial consistency of these
	resting patterns, however, has not yet been evaluated and quantified.
	In this study, we apply a data analysis approach called tensor probabilistic
	independent component analysis to resting-state f{MRI} data to find
	coherencies that are consistent across subjects and sessions. We
	characterize and quantify the consistency of these effects by using
	a bootstrapping approach, and we estimate the BOLD amplitude modulation
	as well as the voxel-wise cross-subject variation. The analysis found
	10 patterns with potential functional relevance, consisting of regions
	known to be involved in motor function, visual processing, executive
	functioning, auditory processing, memory, and the so-called default-mode
	network, each with BOLD signal changes up to 3\%. In general, areas
	with a high mean percentage BOLD signal are consistent and show the
	least variation around the mean. These findings show that the baseline
	activity of the brain is consistent across subjects exhibiting significant
	temporal dynamics, with percentage BOLD signal change comparable
	with the signal changes found in task-related experiments.},

	provides a regional measurement of the expected sensitivity of the

	Maps of the BOLD signal calibration factor showed regional heterogeneity,

	A tacit hypothesis in cognitive arithmetic is that numerical abilities

	representations in animals, infants, normal and gifted adults, and

	and transcoding from one notation to another. While these domains
	are well described by formal symbol-processing models, this paper
	argues that such is not the case for two other domains of numerical
	competence: quantification and approximation. The evidence for counting,
	subitizing and numerosity estimation in infants, children, adults
	and animals is critically examined. Data are also presented which
	suggest a specialization for processing approximate numerical quantities
	in animals and humans. A synthesis of these findings is proposed
	in the form of a triple-code model, which assumes that numbers are
	mentally manipulated in an arabic, verbal or analogical magnitude

	to learning arithmetic. Thirteen right-handed subjects were extensively
	trained on a set of 18 complex multiplication problems. In the following
	fMRI session, trained and untrained problems (closely matched for
	difficulty) were presented in blocked order alternating with a number
	matching task and a fact retrieval task. Importantly, left hemispheric
	activations were dominant in the two contrasts between untrained
	and trained condition, suggesting that learning processes in arithmetic
	are predominantly supported by the left hemisphere. Contrasting untrained
	versus trained condition, the left intraparietal sulcus showed significant
	activations, as well as the inferior parietal lobule. A further significant
	activation was found in the left inferior frontal gyrus. This activation
	may be accounted for by higher working memory demands in the untrained
	as compared to the trained condition. Contrasting trained versus
	untrained condition a significant focus of activation was found in
	the left angular gyrus. Following the triple-code model [Science
	284 (1999) 970], the shift of activation within the parietal lobe
	from the intraparietal sulcus to the left angular gyrus suggests
	a modification from quantity-based processing to more automatic retrieval.
	The present study shows that the left angular gyrus is not only involved
	in arithmetic tasks requiring simple fact retrieval, but may show
	significant activations as a result of relatively short training
	of complex calculation.},

	approach, previously reported to yield higher sensitivity in the
	detection of activation areas. No data are available, however, in
	the literature on the analytic approach and wavelet bases that produce
	optimum results. The present study was undertaken to assess the performance
	of different wavelet decomposition schemes by making use of a "gold
	standard," a realistic computer-simulated phantom. As activation
	areas are then known "a priori," accurate assessments of sensitivity,
	specificity, ROC curve area and spatial resolution can be obtained.
	This approach has allowed us to study the effect of different factors:
	the size of the activation area, activity level, signal-to-noise
	ratio (SNR), use of pre-smoothing, wavelet base function and order
	and resolution level depth. Activations were detected by performing
	t-tests in the wavelet domain and constructing the final image from
	those coefficients that passed the significance test at a given P-value
	threshold. In contrast to previously reported data, our simulation
	study shows that lower wavelet orders and resolution depths should
	be used to obtain optimum results (in terms of ROC curve area). The
	Gabor decomposition offers the maximum fidelity in preserving activation
	area shapes. No major differences were found between other wavelet
	bases functions. Data pre-smoothing increases ROC area for all but
	very small activation region sizes.},

	We describe a new principle for spatially-adaptive estimation: selective

	piecewise-polynomial fits, when equipped with an oracle to select
	the knots, are not dramatically more powerful than selective wavelet
	reconstruction with an oracle. We develop a practical spatially adaptive
	method, Risk Shrink, which works by shrinkage of empirical wavelet

	so. A new inequality in multivariate normal decision theory which
	we call the oracle inequality shows that attained performance differs
	from ideal performance by at most a factor of approximately 2 log
	n, where n is the sample size. Moreover no estimator can give a better
	guarantee than this. Within the class of spatially adaptive procedures,
	RiskShrink is essentially optimal. Relying only on the data, it comes
	within a factor log2n of the performance of piecewise polynomial

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Large-scale tiling array experiments are becoming increasingly
	common in genomics. In particular, the ENCODE project requires the
	consistent segmentation of many different tiling array datasets into
	'active regions' (e.g. finding transfrags from transcriptional data
	and putative binding sites from ChIP-chip experiments). Previously,
	such segmentation was done in an unsupervised fashion mainly based
	on characteristics of the signal distribution in the tiling array
	data itself. Here we propose a supervised framework for doing this.
	It has the advantage of explicitly incorporating validated biological
	knowledge into the model and allowing for formal training and testing.
	METHODOLOGY: In particular, we use a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework,
	which is capable of explicitly modeling the dependency between neighboring
	probes and whose extended version (the generalized HMM) also allows
	explicit description of state duration density. We introduce a formal
	definition of the tiling-array analysis problem, and explain how
	we can use this to describe sampling small genomic regions for experimental
	validation to build up a gold-standard set for training and testing.
	We then describe various ideal and practical sampling strategies
	(e.g. maximizing signal entropy within a selected region versus using
	gene annotation or known promoters as positives for transcription
	or ChIP-chip data, respectively). RESULTS: For the practical sampling
	and training strategies, we show how the size and noise in the validated
	training data affects the performance of an HMM applied to the ENCODE
	transcriptional and ChIP-chip experiments. In particular, we show
	that the HMM framework is able to efficiently process tiling array
	data as well as or better than previous approaches. For the idealized
	sampling strategies, we show how we can assess their performance
	in a simulation framework and how a maximum entropy approach, which
	samples sub-regions with very different signal intensities, gives
	the maximally performing gold-standard. This latter result has strong
	implications for the optimum way medium-scale validation experiments
	should be carried out to verify the results of the genome-scale tiling
	array experiments.},

	paradigms activate a network of spatially distributed cortical areas
	rather than a discrete brain region. Although the neuro-anatomical
	nodes of the rotation network are well established, their specific
	functional role is less well identified. It was the aim of the present
	study to dissociate network components involved in the visual perception
	of 3D cubic objects from regions involved in their mental spatial
	transformation. This was achieved by desynchronizing the time course
	of the perceptional process (i.e., stimulus duration) from the duration
	of the cognitive process (i.e., reaction times) and by comparing
	these with the temporal characteristics of the hemodynamic response
	functions (HRFs) in regions of interest. To minimize intersubject
	variability, an all-female subject group was chosen for this investigation.
	Time-resolved f{MRI} analysis revealed a significant increase in
	the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the HRF with reaction times
	in the supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), in the bilateral premotor
	cortex (PMd-proper), and in the left parietal lobe (PP). The FWHM
	in visual system components such as the bilateral lateral occipital
	complex (LOC) and dorsal extrastriate visual areas (DE) was constant
	across trials and roughly equal to the stimulus duration. These findings
	suggest that visual system activation during mental rotation reflects
	visual perception and can be dissociated from other network components
	whose response characteristics indicates an involvement in the mental
	spatial transformation itself.},

	Here, we demonstrate how a multiparameter classification approach
	can be used to characterize the complex and subtle structural pattern
	of gray matter anatomy implicated in adults with ASD, and to reveal
	spatially distributed patterns of discriminating regions for a variety
	of parameters describing brain anatomy. A set of five morphological
	parameters including volumetric and geometric features at each spatial
	location on the cortical surface was used to discriminate between
	people with ASD and controls using a support vector machine (SVM)
	analytic approach, and to find a spatially distributed pattern of
	regions with maximal classification weights. On the basis of these
	patterns, SVM was able to identify individuals with ASD at a sensitivity
	and specificity of up to 90\% and 80\%, respectively. However, the
	ability of individual cortical features to discriminate between groups
	was highly variable, and the discriminating patterns of regions varied
	across parameters. The classification was specific to ASD rather
	than neurodevelopmental conditions in general (e.g., attention deficit
	hyperactivity disorder). Our results confirm the hypothesis that
	the neuroanatomy of autism is truly multidimensional, and affects
	multiple and most likely independent cortical features. The spatial

	impediment to resolution and sensitivity in functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (f{MRI}). A parallel confounder to f{MRI} data quality is
	geometric image distortion, particularly at high field strengths,
	due to susceptibility-induced magnetic field inhomogeneity. Consequently,
	many high-field echo-planar imaging methods incorporate a post-processing
	distortion correction by acquiring a field map of the sample prior
	to the f{MRI} measurement. However, field mapping methods impose
	a spatial mask on the data, since field information is only obtainable
	from regions with adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This masking,
	when applied to subsequent images in the f{MRI} time series, can
	clip the effects of motion, resulting in inaccurate estimation and
	cosrrection of motion-based changes in the images.Materials and methods
	The effects of geometric distortion correction on automated realignment
	(motion correction) of f{MRI} data are investigated from data acquired
	at 4 T. The results of image realignment with and without prior application
	of distortion correction are compared, using the estimated motion
	parameters and overall image realignment as metrics.Results The application
	of field-map-based distortion correction prior to image realignment
	reduces the amount of motion detected by a standard motion correction
	algorithm. Moreover, motion correction applied before distortion
	correction is shown to result in superior realignment of motion-correction
	images.Conclusion It is preferable to perform motion realignment
	prior to correcting for geometric distortion.},

	for real-time f{MRI} has traditionally been based on hypothesis-driven

  month = {July},
  year = {2000},
  abstract = {Nancy Etcoff's synthesis of up-to-the-minute evolutionary biology,
	neuroscience, social science and literary criticism is the very model
	of good popular science. So why is her account of physical beauty
	so damned titillating? There is nothing salacious here: Etcoff simply
	describes where beauty comes from, what it is for, how it is exploited
	and controlled today, and who stands to gain and lose from its presence
	in the world. There is much here that is shocking, but such shocks
	and surprises are intellectual, rather than erotic. "In Brazil there
	are more Avon ladies than members of the army," Etcoff observes.
	"In the United States more money is spent on beauty than on education
	or social services ... and in 1715 riots broke out in France when
	the use of flour on the hair of aristocrats led to a food shortage."
	
	 Why is reading \_Survival of the Prettiest\_ such an illicit pleasure?
	Perhaps because, in a society informed by Christian ethics and, more
	recently by feminism, we feel uneasy with the manifest injustice
	of physical beauty and the way it runs roughshod over modern notions
	of virtue, democracy and the dignity of the individual. It's like
	the joke about the mother-in-law--as irresistibly funny as it is
	politically unacceptable. Why, then, should we take beauty seriously?
	Because, Etcoff argues, beauty exists. It is not, like mother-in-law
	jokes, a product of the social fabric. It is information, there to
	aid procreation and species survival. We may disapprove of the ways
	we are manipulated at so visceral a level by so primitive a mechanism.
	But to deny beauty its social and political force is an act worthy
	of Canute. "How to live with beauty and bring it back into the realm
	of pleasure is a task for 21st century civilisation," Etcoff writes,
	and, thanks to her, we are off to a good start. --\_Simon Ings\_},

	invariant, short-memory errors but may be inefficient and/or insufficient
	to secure type 1 error control in the context of fractal or scale
	invariant noise with a more slowly decaying autocorrelation function.
	Here we introduce a novel method, called wavelet-generalized least
	squares (WLS), which is (to a good approximation) the best linear
	unbiased (BLU) estimator of regression model parameters in the context
	of long-memory errors. The method also provides maximum likelihood
	(ML) estimates of the Hurst exponent (which can be readily translated
	to the fractal dimension or spectral exponent) characterizing the
	correlational structure of the errors, and the error variance. The
	algorithm exploits the whitening or Karhunen-Loéve-type property
	of the discrete wavelet transform to diagonalize the covariance matrix
	of the errors generated by an iterative fitting procedure after both
	data and design matrix have been transformed to the wavelet domain.
	Properties of this estimator, including its Cramèr-Rao bounds, are
	derived theoretically and compared to its empirical performance on
	a range of simulated data. Compared to ordinary least squares and

	excellent type 1 error control. The method is also applied to some
	real (neurophysiological) data acquired by functional magnetic resonance

  abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Most methods used in functional MRI (f{MRI})
	brain mapping require restrictive assumptions about the shape and
	timing of the f{MRI} signal in activated voxels. Consequently, f{MRI}
	data may be partially and misleadingly characterized, leading to
	suboptimal or invalid inference. To limit these assumptions and to
	capture the broad range of possible activation patterns, a novel
	statistical f{MRI} brain mapping method is proposed. It relies on
	hidden semi-Markov event sequence models (HSMESMs), a special class
	of hidden Markov models (HMMs) dedicated to the modeling and analysis
	of event-based random processes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Activation
	detection is formulated in terms of time coupling between (1) the
	observed sequence of hemodynamic response onset (HRO) events detected
	in the voxel's f{MRI} signal and (2) the "hidden" sequence of task-induced
	neural activation onset (NAO) events underlying the HROs. Both event
	sequences are modeled within a single HSMESM. The resulting brain
	activation model is trained to automatically detect neural activity
	embedded in the input f{MRI} data set under analysis. The data sets
	considered in this article are threefold: synthetic epoch-related,
	real epoch-related (auditory lexical processing task), and real event-related
	(oddball detection task) f{MRI} data sets. RESULTS: Synthetic data:
	Activation detection results demonstrate the superiority of the HSMESM
	mapping method with respect to a standard implementation of the statistical
	parametric mapping (SPM) approach. They are also very close, sometimes
	equivalent, to those obtained with an "ideal" implementation of SPM
	in which the activation patterns synthesized are reused for analysis.
	The HSMESM method appears clearly insensitive to timing variations
	of the hemodynamic response and exhibits low sensitivity to fluctuations
	of its shape (unsustained activation during task). Real epoch-related
	data: HSMESM activation detection results compete with those obtained
	with SPM, without requiring any prior definition of the expected
	activation patterns thanks to the unsupervised character of the HSMESM
	mapping approach. Along with activation maps, the method offers a
	wide range of additional f{MRI} analysis functionalities, including
	activation lag mapping, activation mode visualization, and hemodynamic
	response function analysis. Real event-related data: Activation detection
	results confirm and validate the overall strategy that consists in
	focusing the analysis on the transients, time-localized events that
	are the HROs. CONCLUSION: All the experiments performed on synthetic
	and real f{MRI} data demonstrate the relevance of HSMESMs in f{MRI}
	brain mapping. In particular, the statistical character of these
	models, along with their learning and generalizing abilities are
	of particular interest when dealing with strong variabilities of
	the active f{MRI} signal across time, space, experiments, and subjects.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (f{MRI})
	brain mapping method is presented within the statistical modeling
	framework of hidden semi-Markov event sequence models (HSMESMs).
	Neural activation detection is formulated at the voxel level in terms
	of time coupling between the sequence of hemodynamic response onsets
	(HROs) observed in the f{MRI} signal, and an HSMESM of the hidden
	sequence of task-induced neural activations. The sequence of HRO
	events is derived from a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) of the
	f{MRI} signal. The brain activation HSMESM is built from the timing
	information of the input stimulation protocol. The rich mathematical
	framework of HSMESMs makes these models an effective and versatile
	approach for f{MRI} data analysis. Solving for the HSMESM Evaluation
	and Learning problems enables the model to automatically detect neural
	activation embedded in a given set of f{MRI} signals, without requiring
	any template basis function or prior shape assumption for the f{MRI}
	response. Solving for the HSMESM Decoding problem allows to enrich
	brain mapping with activation lag mapping, activation mode visualizing,
	and hemodynamic response function analysis. Activation detection
	results obtained on synthetic and real epoch-related f{MRI} data
	demonstrate the superiority of the HSMESM mapping method with respect
	to a real application case of the statistical parametric mapping
	(SPM) approach. In addition, the HSMESM mapping method appears clearly
	insensitive to timing variations of the hemodynamic response, and
	exhibits low sensitivity to fluctuations of its shape.},

  abstract = {The issue of how and where arithmetic operations are represented in
	the brain has been addressed in numerous studies. Lesion studies
	suggest that a network of different brain areas are involved in mental
	calculation. Neuroimaging studies have reported inferior parietal
	and lateral frontal activations during mental arithmetic using tasks
	of different complexities and using different operators (addition,
	subtraction, etc.). Indeed, it has been difficult to compare brain
	activation across studies because of the variety of different operators
	and different presentation modalities used. The present experiment
	examined fMRI-BOLD activity in participants during calculation tasks
	entailing different arithmetic operations -- addition, subtraction,
	multiplication and division -- of different complexities. Functional
	imaging data revealed a common activation pattern comprising right
	precuneus, left and right middle and superior frontal regions during
	all arithmetic operations. All other regional activations were operation
	specific and distributed in prominently frontal, parietal and central
	regions when contrasting complex and simple calculation tasks. The
	present results largely confirm former studies suggesting that activation
	patterns due to mental arithmetic appear to reflect a basic anatomical
	substrate of working memory, numerical knowledge and processing based
	on finger counting, and derived from a network originally related
	to finger movement. We emphasize that in mental arithmetic research
	different arithmetic operations should always be examined and discussed
	independently of each other in order to avoid invalid generalizations

	imaging is the electric current of masses of dendrites. The prodigious
	demands for the energy that is required to drive the dendritic currents
	are met by hemodynamic and metabolic responses that are visualized
	with f{MRI} and PET techniques. The high current densities in parallel
	dendritic shafts and the broad distributions of the loop currents
	outside the dendrites generate both the scalp EEG and the magnetic
	fields seen in the MEG. The measurements of image intensities and
	potential fields provide state variables for modeling. The relationships
	between the intensities of current density and the electric, magnetic,

	The state variables are complementary, because the information they
	convey comes from differing albeit overlapping neural populations,
	so that efforts to cross-validate localization of neural activity
	relating to specified cognitive behaviors have not always been successful.
	We propose an alternative way to use the three methods in combination

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Evaluate spectral scaling properties of scalp electroencephalogram
	(EEG) and electromyogram (EMG), optimal spacing of electrodes, and
	strategies for mitigating EMG. METHODS: EEG was recorded referentially
	from 9 subjects with a 64 channel linear array (electrodes 3mm apart)
	placed parasagittally or transversely on forehead or occiput, at
	rest with eyes open or closed, or with deliberate EMG. Temporal (PSD(t))
	and spatial (PSD(x)) power spectral densities were calculated with
	one-dimensional fast Fourier transform (FFT) for comparison with
	earlier analyses of intracranial EEG. RESULTS: Scaling of PSD(t)
	from scalp resembled that from pia: near-linear decrease in log power
	with increasing log frequency (1/f(alpha)). Scalp PSD(x) decreased
	non-linearly and more rapidly than PSD(x) from pia. Peaks in PSD(t)
	(especially 4-12Hz) and PSD(x) (especially 0.1-0.4 cycles/cm) revealed
	departures from 1/f(alpha). EMG power in PSD(t) was more "white"
	than 1/f(alpha). CONCLUSIONS: Smearing by dura-skull-scalp distorts
	PSD(x) more than PSD(t) of scalp EEG from 1/f(alpha) scaling at the
	pia. Spatial spectral peaks suggest that optimal scalp electrode
	spacing might be approximately 1cm to capture non-local EEG components
	having the texture of gyri. Mitigation of EMG by filtering is unsatisfactory.
	A criterion for measuring EMG may support biofeedback for training
	subjects to reduce their EMG. SIGNIFICANCE: High-density recording
	and log-log spectral display of EEG provide a foundation for holist
	studies of global human brain function, as an alternative to network
	approaches that decompose EEG into localized, modular signals for
	correlation and coherence.},

  note = {Dissertation No 836, ISBN 91-7373-699-6},
  abstract = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (f{MRI}) is a recently developed
	neuroimaging technique with capacity to map neural activity with
	high spatial precision. To locate active brain areas, the method
	utilizes local blood oxygenation changes which are reflected as small
	intensity changes in a special type of {MR} images. The ability to
	non-invasively map brain functions provides new opportunities to
	unravel the mysteries and advance the understanding of the human
	brain, as well as to perform pre-surgical examinations in order to
	optimize surgical interventions. This dissertation introduces new
	approaches for the analysis of f{MRI} data. The detection of active
	brain areas is a challenging problem due to high noise levels and
	artifacts present in the data. A fundamental tool in the developed
	methods is Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). CCA is used in two
	novel ways. First as a method with the ability to fully exploit the
	spatio-temporal nature of f{MRI} data for detecting active brain
	areas. Established analysis approaches mainly focus on the temporal
	dimension of the data and they are for this reason commonly referred
	to as being mass-univariate. The new CCA detection method encompasses
	and generalizes the traditional mass-univariate methods and can in
	this terminology be viewed as a mass-multivariate approach. The concept
	of spatial basis functions is introduced as a spatial counterpart
	of the temporal basis functions already in use in f{MRI} analysis.
	The spatial basis functions implicitly perform an adaptive spatial
	filtering of the f{MRI} images, which significantly improves detection
	performance. It is also shown how prior information can be incorporated
	into the analysis by imposing constraints on the temporal and spatial
	models and a constrained version of CCA is devised to this end. A
	general Principal Component Analysis technique for generating and
	constraining temporal and spatial subspace models is proposed to
	be used in combination with the constrained CCA analysis approach.
	The second use of CCA is found in a novel so-called exploratory analysis
	method which extracts interesting and representative structures in
	f{MRI} data. Functional {MRI} data sets are large, and exploratory
	analysis methods are useful for probing the data for unexpected components.
	It is also shown how drift and trend models adapted to the f{MRI}
	data set at hand can be constructed with this new exploratory CCA
	technique. Compared to traditionally employed drift models, such
	adaptive drift models better account for the temporal autocorrelation
	in the data}

  abstract = {This paper introduces a multivariate Bayesian (MVB) scheme to decode
	or recognise brain states from neuroimages. It resolves the ill-posed
	many-to-one mapping, from voxel values or data features to a target
	variable, using a parametric empirical or hierarchical Bayesian model.
	This model is inverted using standard variational techniques, in
	this case expectation maximisation, to furnish the model evidence
	and the conditional density of the model's parameters. This allows
	one to compare different models or hypotheses about the mapping from
	functional or structural anatomy to perceptual and behavioural consequences
	(or their deficits). We frame this approach in terms of decoding
	measured brain states to predict or classify outcomes using the rhetoric
	established in pattern classification of neuroimaging data. However,
	the aim of MVB is not to predict (because the outcomes are known)
	but to enable inference on different models of structure-function
	mappings; such as distributed and sparse representations. This allows
	one to optimise the model itself and produce predictions that outperform
	standard pattern classification approaches, like support vector machines.
	Technically, the model inversion and inference uses the same empirical
	Bayesian procedures developed for ill-posed inverse problems (e.g.,
	source reconstruction in EEG). However, the MVB scheme used here
	extends this approach to include a greedy search for sparse solutions.
	It reduces the problem to the same form used in Gaussian process
	modelling, which affords a generic and efficient scheme for model
	optimisation and evaluating model evidence. We illustrate MVB using
	simulated and real data, with a special focus on model comparison;
	where models can differ in the form of the mapping (i.e., neuronal
	representation) within one region, or in the (combination of) regions
	per se.},

  abstract = {By formulating Helmholtz's ideas about perception, in terms of modern-day
	theories, one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning
	that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts: using
	constructs from statistical physics, the problems of inferring the
	causes of sensory input and learning the causal structure of their
	generation can be resolved using exactly the same principles. Furthermore,
	inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion.
	The ensuing scheme rests on Empirical Bayes and hierarchical models
	of how sensory input is caused. The use of hierarchical models enables
	the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive
	fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many
	aspects of cortical organisation and responses. In this paper, we
	show these perceptual processes are just one aspect of emergent behaviours
	of systems that conform to a free energy principle. The free energy
	considered here measures the difference between the probability distribution
	of environmental quantities that act on the system and an arbitrary
	distribution encoded by its configuration. The system can minimise
	free energy by changing its configuration to affect the way it samples
	the environment or change the distribution it encodes. These changes
	correspond to action and perception respectively and lead to an adaptive
	exchange with the environment that is characteristic of biological
	systems. This treatment assumes that the system's state and structure
	encode an implicit and probabilistic model of the environment. We
	will look at the models entailed by the brain and how minimisation
	of its free energy can explain its dynamics and structure.},

	the effective connectivity between them inherently dynamic and context-sensitive.
	One emerging architectural principle of functional brain organization,
	which rests explicitly on these nonlinear interactions, is that neuronal
	responses expressed at any level in a sensory hierarchy reflect an
	interaction between (i) bottom up "driving" afferents from lower
	cortical areas and (ii) backwards "modulatory" inputs from higher
	areas that mediate top-down contextual effects. A compelling example
	is attentional modulation of responses in functionally specialized
	sensory areas. The aim of this work was to demonstrate that parietal
	regions may mediate selective attention to motion by modulating the
	effective connectivity from early visual cortex to the motion-sensitive
	area V5/MT. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, and an analysis
	of effective connectivity based on nonlinear system identification,
	we found that backwards modulatory influences from the posterior
	parietal cortex are sufficient to account for a significant component
	of attentional modulation of V5/MT responses to "driving" inputs
	from V2. By explicitly modeling interactions among inputs to V5/MT,
	we were able to make inferences about the influences of V2 inputs
	and their concomitant activity-dependent modulation by parietal afferents.
	The latter effects embody dynamic changes in effective connectivity
	that may underlie attentional mechanisms. These results speak to
	the context-sensitive nature of functional integration in the brain
	and provide empirical evidence that attentional effects may be mediated
	by backwards connections, of a modulatory sort, in humans.},

	another area and some experimental (sensory or task-related) parameter.
	We refer to these effects as psychophysiological interactions and
	relate them to interactions based solely on experimental factors
	(i.e., psychological interactions), in factorial designs, and interactions
	among neurophysiological measurements (i.e., physiological interactions).
	We have framed psychophysiological interactions in terms of functional
	integration by noting that the degree to which the activity in one
	area can be predicted, on the basis of activity in another, corresponds
	to the contribution of the second to the first, where this contribution
	can be related to effective connectivity. A psychophysiological interaction
	means that the contribution of one area to another changes significantly
	with the experimental or psychological context. Alternatively these
	interactions can be thought of as a contribution-dependent change
	in regional responses to an experimental or psychological factor.
	In other words the contribution can be thought of as modulating the
	responses elicited by a particular stimulus or psychological process.
	The potential importance of this approach lies in (i) conferring
	a degree of functional specificity on this aspect of effective connectivity
	and (ii) providing a model of modulation, where the contribution
	from a distal area can be considered to modulate responses to the
	psychological or stimulus-specific factor defining the interaction.
	Although distinct in neurobiological terms, these are equivalent
	perspectives on the same underlying interaction. We illustrate these
	points using a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of attention
	to visual motion and a position emission tomography study of visual
	priming. We focus on interactions among extrastriate, inferotemporal,
	and posterior parietal regions during visual processing, under different

	Bayes as a potentially useful way to estimate and make inferences
	about effects in hierarchical models. In this paper we present a
	series of models that exemplify the diversity of problems that can
	be addressed within this framework. In hierarchical linear observation
	models, both classical and empirical Bayesian approaches can be framed
	in terms of covariance component estimation (e.g., variance partitioning).
	To illustrate the use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm
	in covariance component estimation we focus first on two important
	problems in f{MRI}: nonsphericity induced by (i) serial or temporal
	correlations among errors and (ii) variance components caused by
	the hierarchical nature of multisubject studies. In hierarchical
	observation models, variance components at higher levels can be used
	as constraints on the parameter estimates of lower levels. This enables
	the use of parametric empirical Bayesian (PEB) estimators, as distinct
	from classical maximum likelihood (ML) estimates. We develop this
	distinction to address: (i) The difference between response estimates
	based on ML and the conditional means from a Bayesian approach and
	the implications for estimates of intersubject variability. (ii)
	The relationship between fixed- and random-effect analyses. (iii)
	The specificity and sensitivity of Bayesian inference and, finally,
	(iv) the relative importance of the number of scans and subjects.
	The forgoing is concerned with within- and between-subject variability
	in multisubject hierarchical f{MRI} studies. In the second half of
	this paper we turn to Bayesian inference at the first (within-voxel)
	level, using PET data to show how priors can be derived from the
	(between-voxel) distribution of activations over the brain. This
	application uses exactly the same ideas and formalism but, in this
	instance, the second level is provided by observations over voxels
	as opposed to subjects. The ensuing posterior probability maps (PPMs)
	have enhanced anatomical precision and greater face validity, in
	relation to underlying anatomy. Furthermore, in comparison to conventional
	SPMs they are not confounded by the multiple comparison problem that,
	in a classical context, dictates high thresholds and low sensitivity.
	We conclude with some general comments on Bayesian approaches to
	image analysis and on some unresolved issues.},

	f{MRI}. These nonlinearities are commonly expressed as interactions
	among stimuli that can lead to the suppression and increased latency
	of responses to a stimulus that are incurred by a preceding stimulus.
	We have presented previously a model-free characterization of these
	effects using generic techniques from nonlinear system identification,
	namely a Volterra series formulation. At the same time Buxton et
	al. (1998) described a plausible and compelling dynamical model of

	that underpins the evolution of the f{MRI} signal. In this paper
	we combine these system identification and model-based approaches
	and ask whether the Balloon model is sufficient to account for the
	nonlinear behaviors observed in real time series. We conclude that
	it can, and furthermore the model parameters that ensue are biologically
	plausible. This conclusion is based on the observation that the Balloon
	model can produce Volterra kernels that emulate empirical kernels.
	To enable this evaluation we had to embed the Balloon model in a
	hemodynamic input-state-output model that included the dynamics of
	perfusion changes that are contingent on underlying synaptic activation.
	This paper presents (i) the full hemodynamic model (ii), how its
	associated Volterra kernels can be derived, and (iii) addresses the
	model's validity in relation to empirical nonlinear characterizations

	represents an implicit assumption behind many (but not all) studies
	that employ cognitive subtraction. The main contention is that pure
	insertion is not valid in relation to the neuronal instantiation
	of cognitive processes. Pure insertion asserts that there are no
	interactions among the cognitive components of a task. It is possible
	to evaluate and refute this assumption by testing explicitly for
	interactions using factorial experimental designs. It is proposed
	that factorial designs are more powerful than subtraction designs
	in characterizing cognitive neuroanatomy, precisely because they
	allow for interactions and eschew notions like pure insertion. In
	particular we suggest that the effect of a cognitive component (i.e.,
	an effect that is independent of other components) is best captured
	by the main (activation) effect of that component and that the integration
	among components (i.e., the expression of one cognitive process in
	the context of another) can be assessed with the interaction terms.
	In this framework a complete characterization of cognitive neuroanatomy
	includes both regionally specific activations and regionally specific
	interactions. To illustrate our point we have used a factorial experimental
	design to show that inferotemporal activations, due to object recognition,
	are profoundly modulated by phonological retrieval of the object's
	name. This interaction implicates the inferotemporal regions in phonological
	retrieval, during object naming, despite the fact that phonological

	garrote. We show that the non-negative garrote shrinkage estimate
	enjoys the same asymptotic convergence rate as the hard and the soft
	shrinkage estimates. Simulations are used to demonstrate that garrote
	shrinkage offers advantages over both hard shrinkage (generally smaller
	mean-square-error and less sensitivity to small perturbations in
	the data) and soft shrinkage (generally smaller bias and overall
	mean-square-error). The minimax thresholds for the non-negative garrote
	are derived and the threshold selection procedure based on Stein's
	unbiased risk estimate (SURE) is studied. We also propose a threshold
	selection procedure based on combining Coifman and Donoho's cycle-spinning
	and SURE. The procedure is called SPINSURE. We use examples to show
	that SPINSURE is more stable than SURE: smaller standard deviation
	and smaller range.},

  abstract = {Functional localization is a concept which involves the application
	of a sequence of geometrical and statistical image processing operations
	in order to define the location of brain activity or to produce functional/parametric
	maps with respect to the brain structure or anatomy. Considering
	that functional brain images do not normally convey detailed structural
	information and, thus, do not present an anatomically specific localization
	of functional activity, various image registration techniques are
	introduced in the literature for the purpose of mapping functional
	activity into an anatomical image or a brain atlas. The problems
	addressed by these techniques differ depending on the application
	and the type of analysis, i.e., single-subject versus group analysis.
	Functional to anatomical brain image registration is the core part
	of functional localization in most applications and is accompanied
	by intersubject and subject-to-atlas registration for group analysis
	studies. Cortical surface registration and automatic brain labeling
	are some of the other tools towards establishing a fully automatic
	functional localization procedure. While several previous survey
	papers have reviewed and classified general-purpose medical image
	registration techniques, this paper provides an overview of brain
	functional localization along with a survey and classification of
	the image registration techniques related to this problem.},

  abstract = {The temporal characteristics of the BOLD response in sensorimotor
	and auditory cortices were measured in subjects performing finger
	tapping while listening to metronome pacing tones. A repeated trial
	paradigm was used with stimulus durations of 167 ms to 16 s and intertrial
	times of 30 s. Both cortical systems were found to be nonlinear in
	that the response to a long stimulus could not be predicted by convolving
	the 1-s response with a rectangular function. In the short-time regime,
	the amplitude of the response varied only slowly with stimulus duration.
	It was found that this character was predicted with a modification
	to Buxton's balloon model. Wiener deconvolution was used to deblur
	the response to concatenated short episodes of finger tapping at
	different temporal separations and at rates from 1 to 4 Hz. While
	the measured response curves were distorted by overlap between the
	individual episodes, the deconvolved response at each rate was found
	to agree well with separate scans at each of the individual rates.
	Thus, although the impulse response cannot predict the response to
	fully overlapping stimuli, linear deconvolution is effective when
	the stimuli are separated by at least 4 s. The deconvolution filter
	must be measured for each subject using a short-stimulus paradigm.
	It is concluded that deconvolution may be effective in diminishing
	the hemodynamically imposed temporal blurring and may have potential
	applications in quantitating responses in eventrelated f{MRI}.},

	It is based on the optical flow, the divergence-free and the smoothness

	we studied the restriction of this approach to the boundary of the
	left ventricular (LV) cavity. The behaviour of the method is quantified
	through simulations approximating the overall motion of the LV cavity
	through an affine transform involving a dilation and a rotation.
	The method implies the choice of three parameters weighting the constraints.
	The results show a weak dependence of the velocity field on the weighting
	of the optical flow constraint. The accuracy of the method relies
	more heavily on the relative weighting of the smoothness and divergence-free
	constraints. In our experiments, the best results were obtained for
	a largely predominant divergence-free constraint. The results also
	show that the accuracy of the method is reasonable for low values

  title = {{The Power and Paradox of Physical Attractiveness}},
  month = {April},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {The Power and Paradox of Physical Attractiveness is a scholarly look
	into physical attractiveness. It articulates the great importance
	placed on this dimension of a person?s appearance. Analysis of the
	dynamics and consequences reveals a powerful, pervasive, and frequently
	unrecognized or denied physical attractiveness phenomenon. This phenomenon
	transcends time, geography, and culture, regardless of demographics
	and socioeconomics of individuals and populations.
	
	 With penetrating vision, Dr. Patzer provides evidence that despite
	professed ideals, people do judge others by their looks. Physical
	attractiveness is a more powerful determinant of a person?s fortune
	and misfortune in life than people admit. No matter the words, thoughts,
	and ideals proclaimed by people, these same people judge, assume,
	infer, believe, act, treat, decide, accept, reject, and behave toward
	or against individuals, in patterns consistent with their own physical
	attractiveness and that of others. While many dimensions define appearance,
	physical attractiveness predominates.
	
	 The physical attractiveness of a person impacts every individual
	throughout every community, across the United States and around the
	world. All people inherit and alter their physical attractiveness,
	which is determined by complex, interdependent, physical and non-physical
	factors. Hidden and not- hidden values drive thoughts and actions
	with significant effects and realities whereby higher physical attractiveness
	is beneficial, lower physical attractiveness is detrimental, and
	associated pursuits are relentless.
	
	 Physical attractiveness may look skin-deep as a surface aspect of
	appearance, but looks can be deceiving. Researchers throughout the
	world collect empirical data complemented with anecdotal data to
	probe beyond the surfaces. Through investigations that meet meticulous
	scientific methodological procedures, acute observations reveal previously
	undetected dimensions that advance understanding about physical attractiveness.
	The Power and Paradox of Physical Attractiveness explores, discovers,
	and documents the theories, evidence, and circumstances in which
	physical attractiveness is a remarkable veneer with influences that
	extend considerably beyond what we call skin-deep.
	
	 The author, Dr. Patzer, formally cites more than 750 references as
	he identifies a complex phenomenon in which physical attractiveness
	serves as an informational cue that propels a multiple-stage process.
	Through this process, people knowingly and unknowingly infer extensive
	information based on this cue, which in-turn triggers assumptions,
	expectations, attitudes, and behaviors. It ultimately leads to powerful
	consequences with significant benefits and detriments for every person,
	accompanied by continuous pursuits toward these benefits and away
	from these detriments, caused by his or her level of physical attractiveness.
	
	 What the Experts are Saying
	
	 Gordon Patzer makes me think. This is a high compliment in a world
	of vapid sound bytes and meaningless clich\'{e}s. Having written
	a cover story on the subject of beauty for Psychology Today, I feel
	qualified to say that Patzer?s work is interesting, fearless and
	even inspired. If a profound writer?s job is to comfort the afflicted
	while afflicting the comfortable, Patzer continues to pass this test.

	 Gordon Patzer has been the "bottom-line" expert on the subject of
	physical attractiveness for decades. His pioneering research in the
	field has been well tested and respected in the world of academia,
	and now, through The Power and Paradox of Physical Attractiveness,
	his knowledge and expertise are revealed to the much larger world.
	Despite ignorant platitudes regularly offered up by the politically

	of causality between two related variables and also whether or not
	feedback is occurring. Testable definitions of causality and feedback
	are proposed and illustrated by use of simple two-variable models.
	The important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed
	and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness
	in recordhag information or because a sufficiently wide class of
	possible causal variables has not been used. It can be shown that
	the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two
	parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation.
	Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed.
	A generalization of this result with the partial cross spectrum is
	suggested.The object of this paper is to throw light on the relationships
	between certain classes of econometric models involving feedback
	and the functions arising in spectral analysis, particularly the
	cross spectrum and the partial cross spectrum. Causality and feedback
	are here defined in an explicit and testable fashion. It is shown
	that in the two-variable case the feedback mechanism can be broken
	down into two causal relations and that the cross spectrum can be
	considered as the sum of two cross spectra, each closely connected
	with one of the causations. The next three sections of the paper
	briefly introduce those aspects of spectral methods, model building,
	and causality which are required later. Section IV presents the results

	that these regions constitute a network supporting a default mode
	of brain function. In this study, we investigate three questions
	pertaining to this hypothesis: Does such a resting-state network
	exist in the human brain? Is it modulated during simple sensory processing?
	How is it modulated during cognitive processing? To address these
	questions, we defined PCC and vACC regions that showed decreased
	activity during a cognitive (working memory) task, then examined
	their functional connectivity during rest. PCC was strongly coupled
	with vACC and several other brain regions implicated in the default
	mode network. Next, we examined the functional connectivity of PCC
	and vACC during a visual processing task and show that the resultant
	connectivity maps are virtually identical to those obtained during
	rest. Last, we defined three lateral prefrontal regions showing increased
	activity during the cognitive task and examined their resting-state
	connectivity. We report significant inverse correlations among all
	three lateral prefrontal regions and PCC, suggesting a mechanism
	for attenuation of default mode network activity during cognitive
	processing. This study constitutes, to our knowledge, the first resting-state
	connectivity analysis of the default mode and provides the most compelling
	evidence to date for the existence of a cohesive default mode network.
	Our findings also provide insight into how this network is modulated

	Prominent coactivation of the hippocampus, detected in all groups,
	suggests that the default-mode network is closely involved with episodic
	memory processing. The AD group showed decreased resting-state activity
	in the posterior cingulate and hippocampus, suggesting that disrupted

	similar cortical networks consisting of bilateral prefrontal, premotor

	case, there may be specific areas diagnostic for house stimuli (e.g.,
	LO) or for face stimuli (e.g., STS); however, in contrast to the

  pages = {508 - 521},
  abstract = {Summary In the previous chapter, we dealt with functional connectivity
	and different ways of summarizing patterns of correlations among
	brain systems. In this chapter, we turn to effective connectivity
	and mechanistic models that might mediate these correlations. This
	chapter can be regarded as an introduction to different models of
	effective connectivity covered in the remaining chapters of this
	Part. Brain function depends on interactions among its components
	that range from individual cell compartments to neuronal populations.
	As described in Chapter 36, anatomical and physiological in vivo
	studies of connectivity suggest a hierarchy of specialized regions
	that process increasingly abstract features, e.g. from simple edges
	in V1, through colour and motion in V4 and V5 respectively, to faces
	in the fusiform gyrus. These specialized regions are connected, allowing
	distributed and recurrent neuronal information processing. This means
	their selective responses, or specialization, are a function of connectivity.
	An important theme in this chapter is that connections can change
	in a context-sensitive way. We refer to these changes as plasticity,
	to describe changes in the influence different brain systems have
	on each other. The formation of distributed networks, through dynamic
	interactions, is the basis of functional integration, which is time-
	and context-dependent. Changes in connectivity are important for
	development, learning, perception and adaptive response to injury.},

  abstract = {We recently outlined a Bayesian scheme for analyzing fMRI data using
	diffusion-based spatial priors [Harrison, L.M., Penny, W., Ashburner,
	J., Trujillo-Barreto, N., Friston, K.J., 2007. Diffusion-based spatial
	priors for imaging. NeuroImage 38, 677-695]. The current paper continues
	this theme, applying it to a single-subject functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI) study of the auditory system. We show that spatial
	priors on functional activations, based on diffusion, can be formulated
	in terms of the eigenmodes of a graph Laplacian. This allows one
	to discard eigenmodes with small eigenvalues, to provide a computationally
	efficient scheme. Furthermore, this formulation shows that diffusion-based
	priors are a generalization of conventional Laplacian priors [Penny,
	W.D., Trujillo-Barreto, N.J., Friston, K.J., 2005. Bayesian fMRI
	time series analysis with spatial priors. NeuroImage 24, 350-362].
	Finally, we show how diffusion-based priors are a special case of
	Gaussian process models that can be inverted using classical covariance
	component estimation techniques like restricted maximum likelihood
	[Patterson, H.D., Thompson, R., 1974. Maximum likelihood estimation
	of components of variance. Paper presented at: 8th International
	Biometrics Conference (Constanta, Romania)]. The convention in SPM
	is to smooth data with a fixed isotropic Gaussian kernel before inverting
	a mass-univariate statistical model. This entails the strong assumption
	that data are generated smoothly throughout the brain. However, there
	is no way to determine if this assumption is supported by the data,
	because data are smoothed before statistical modeling. In contrast,
	if a spatial prior is used, smoothness is estimated given non-smoothed
	data. Explicit spatial priors enable formal model comparison of different
	prior assumptions, e.g., that data are generated from a stationary
	(i.e., fixed throughout the brain) or non-stationary spatial process.
	Indeed, for the auditory data we provide strong evidence for a non-stationary
	process, which concurs with a qualitative comparison of predicted
	activations at the boundary of functionally selective regions.},

	spatial priors [Harrison, L.M., Penny, W., Daunizeau, J., and Friston,
	K.J. (2008). Diffusion-based spatial priors for functional magnetic
	resonance images. Neuroimage.] were proposed, which provide a way
	to formulate an adaptive spatial basis, where the diffusion kernel
	of a weighted graph-Laplacian (WGL) is used as the prior covariance
	matrix over GLM parameters. An advantage of these is that they can
	be used to relax the assumption of isotropy and stationarity implicit
	in smoothing data with a fixed Gaussian kernel. The limitation of
	diffusion-based models is purely computational, due to the large
	number of voxels in a brain volume. One solution is to partition
	a brain volume into slices, using a spatial model for each slice.
	This reduces computational burden by approximating the full WGL with
	a block diagonal form, where each block can be analysed separately.
	While f{MRI} data are collected in slices, the functional structures
	exhibiting spatial coherence and continuity are generally three-dimensional,
	calling for a more informed partition. We address this using the
	graph-Laplacian to divide a brain volume into sub-graphs, whose shape
	can be arbitrary. Their shape depends crucially on edge weights of
	the graph, which can be based on the Euclidean distance between voxels
	(isotropic) or on GLM parameters (anisotropic) encoding functional
	responses. The result is an approximation the full WGL that retains
	its 3D form and also has potential for parallelism. We applied the
	method to high-resolution (1 mm(3)) f{MRI} data and compared models
	where a volume was divided into either slices or graph-partitions.
	Models were optimized using Expectation-Maximization and the approximate
	log-evidence computed to compare these different ways to partition
	a spatial prior. The high-resolution f{MRI} data presented here had
	greatest evidence for the graph partitioned anisotropic model, which
	was best able to preserve fine functional detail.},

  abstract = {Visual working memory provides an essential link between perception
	and higher cognitive functions, allowing for the active maintenance
	of information about stimuli no longer in view. Research suggests
	that sustained activity in higher-order prefrontal, parietal, inferotemporal
	and lateral occipital areas supports visual maintenance, and may
	account for the limited capacity of working memory to hold up to
	3-4 items. Because higher-order areas lack the visual selectivity
	of early sensory areas, it has remained unclear how observers can
	remember specific visual features, such as the precise orientation
	of a grating, with minimal decay in performance over delays of many
	seconds. One proposal is that sensory areas serve to maintain fine-tuned
	feature information, but early visual areas show little to no sustained
	activity over prolonged delays. Here we show that orientations held
	in working memory can be decoded from activity patterns in the human
	visual cortex, even when overall levels of activity are low. Using
	functional magnetic resonance imaging and pattern classification
	methods, we found that activity patterns in visual areas V1-V4 could
	predict which of two oriented gratings was held in memory with mean
	accuracy levels upwards of 80\%, even in participants whose activity
	fell to baseline levels after a prolonged delay. These orientation-selective
	activity patterns were sustained throughout the delay period, evident
	in individual visual areas, and similar to the responses evoked by
	unattended, task-irrelevant gratings. Our results demonstrate that
	early visual areas can retain specific information about visual features

  abstract = {The brain's most difficult computation in decision-making learning
	is searching for essential information related to rewards among vast
	multimodal inputs and then integrating it into beneficial behaviors.
	Contextual cues consisting of limbic, cognitive, visual, auditory,
	somatosensory, and motor signals need to be associated with both
	rewards and actions by utilizing an internal representation such
	as reward prediction and reward prediction error. Previous studies
	have suggested that a suitable brain structure for such integration
	is the neural circuitry associated with multiple cortico-striatal
	loops. However, computational exploration still remains into how
	the information in and around these multiple closed loops can be
	shared and transferred. Here, we propose a #heterarchical##reinforcement##learning#
	model, where reward prediction made by more limbic and cognitive
	loops is propagated to motor loops by spiral projections between
	the striatum and substantia nigra, assisted by cortical projections
	to the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, which sends excitatory
	input to the substantia nigra. The model makes several fMRI-testable
	predictions of brain activity during stimulus-action-reward association
	learning. The caudate nucleus and the cognitive cortical areas are
	correlated with reward prediction error, while the putamen and motor-related
	areas are correlated with stimulus-action-dependent reward prediction.
	Furthermore, a heterogeneous activity pattern within the striatum
	is predicted depending on learning difficulty, i.e., the anterior
	medial caudate nucleus will be correlated more with reward prediction
	error when learning becomes difficult, while the posterior putamen
	will be correlated more with stimulus-action-dependent reward prediction
	in easy learning. Our fMRI results revealed that different cortico-striatal
	loops are operating, as suggested by the proposed model.},

	Here, we used binocular rivalry to induce frequent spontaneous and

	The number of activated voxels in the visual cortex, the percent

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional brain imaging studies have indicated that distinct
	anatomical brain regions can show coherent spontaneous neuronal activity
	during rest. Regions that show such correlated behavior are said
	to form resting-state networks (RSNs). RSNs have been investigated
	using seed-dependent functional connectivity maps and by using a
	number of model-free methods. However, examining RSNs across a group
	of subjects is still a complex task and often involves human input
	in selecting meaningful networks. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
	We report on a voxel based model-free normalized cut graph clustering
	approach with whole brain coverage for group analysis of resting-state
	data, in which the number of RSNs is computed as an optimal clustering
	fit of the data. Inter-voxel correlations of time-series are grouped
	at the individual level and the consistency of the resulting networks
	across subjects is clustered at the group level, defining the group
	RSNs. We scanned a group of 26 subjects at rest with a fast BOLD
	sensitive f{MRI} scanning protocol on a 3 Tesla MR scanner. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
	An optimal group clustering fit revealed 7 RSNs. The 7 RSNs included
	motor/visual, auditory and attention networks and the frequently
	reported default mode network. The found RSNs showed large overlap
	with recently reported resting-state results and support the idea
	of the formation of spatially distinct RSNs during rest in the human
	brain.},

	connectivity, representing the brain as a network of brain regions,
	requiring an arbitrary definition of such regions. However, using
	a voxel-wise approach allows for the model-free examination of both
	inter-regional as well as intra-regional connectivity and might reveal
	new information on network organization. Especially, a voxel-based
	study could give information about a possible scale-free organization
	of functional connectivity in the human brain. Resting-state 3 Tesla
	f{MRI} recordings of 28 healthy subjects were acquired and individual
	connectivity graphs were formed out of all cortical and sub-cortical
	voxels with connections reflecting inter-voxel functional connectivity.
	Graph characteristics from these connectivity networks were computed.
	The clustering-coefficient of these networks turned out to be much
	higher than the clustering-coefficient of comparable random graphs,
	together with a short average path length, indicating a small-world
	organization. Furthermore, the connectivity distribution of the number
	of inter-voxel connections followed a power-law scaling with an exponent
	close to 2, suggesting a scale-free network topology. Our findings
	suggest a combined small-world and scale-free organization of the
	functionally connected human brain. The results are interpreted as
	evidence for a highly efficient organization of the functionally
	connected brain, in which voxels are mostly connected with their
	direct neighbors forming clustered sub-networks, which are held together
	by a small number of highly connected hub-voxels that ensure a high
	level of overall connectivity.},

	aspects of number processing and calculation: For instance, the meaning
	of a digit in a multi-digit number is coded following spatial information,
	given its association to its relative position within the number;

	the correct location of the intermediate results. In this review

	radial checkerboard patterns containing both color and luminance

	by maximising the likelihood of a particular model shape given a
	voxel-intensity-based feature that represents an estimate of surface

	of gland deformation, which is trained using data provided by biomechanical
	simulations. Each simulation predicts the motion of a volumetric
	finite element mesh due to the random placement of a TRUS probe in
	the rectum. The use of biomechanical modelling in this way also allows
	a dense displacement field to be calculated within the prostate,

  abstract = {A well-recognized problem with the echo-planar imaging (EPI) technique
	most commonly used for functional magnetic resonance imaging (f{MRI})
	studies is geometric distortion caused by magnetic field inhomogeneity.
	This makes it difficult to achieve an accurate registration between
	a functional activation map calculated from an EPI time series and
	an undistorted, high resolution anatomical image. A correction method
	based on mapping the spatial distribution of field inhomogeneities
	can be used to reduce these distortions. This approach is attractive
	in its simplicity but requires postprocessing to improve the robustness
	of the acquired field map and reduce any secondary artifacts. Furthermore,
	the distribution of the internal magnetic field throughout the head
	is position dependent resulting in an interaction between distortion
	and head motion. Therefore, a single field map may not be sufficient
	to correct for the distortions throughout a whole f{MRI} time series.
	In this paper we present a quantitative evaluation of image distortion
	correction for f{MRI} at 2T. We assess (i) methods for the acquisition
	and calculation of field maps, (ii) the effect of image distortion
	correction on the coregistration between anatomical and functional
	images, and (iii) the interaction between distortion and head motion,
	assessing the feasibility of using field maps to reduce this effect.
	We propose that field maps with acceptable noise levels can be generated
	easily using a dual echo-time EPI sequence and demonstrate the importance
	of distortion correction for anatomical coregistration, even for
	small distortions. Using a dual echo-time series to generate a unique
	field map at each time point, we characterize the interaction between
	head motion and geometric distortion. However, we suggest that the
	variance between successively measured field maps introduces additional
	unwanted variance in the voxel time-series and is therefore not adequate
	to correct for time-varying distortions.},

	for both the neural activity and the hemodynamics. We compare two

	Using a split-half resampling procedure (Strother, Anderson, \& Hansen,
	2002), we compare the generalization abilities of the models as well

	obtained by scalar wavelet and multiwavelet transforms, to remedy
	problems associated with high dimension of functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (f{MRI}) time series (when they are used directly in clustering
	algorithms) and their poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that limits
	accurate classification of f{MRI} time series according to their
	activation contents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using randomization,
	the proposed method finds wavelet/multiwavelet coefficients that
	represent the activation content of f{MRI} time series and combines
	them to define new feature spaces. Using simulated and experimental
	f{MRI} data sets, the proposed feature spaces are compared to the
	cross-correlation (CC) feature space and their performances are evaluated.
	In these studies, the false positive detection rate is controlled
	using randomization. To compare different methods, several points
	of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, using simulated
	data, are estimated and compared. RESULTS: The proposed features
	suppress the effects of confounding signals and improve activation
	detection sensitivity. Experimental results show improved sensitivity
	and robustness of the proposed method compared to the conventional
	CC analysis. CONCLUSION: More accurate and sensitive activation detection
	can be achieved using the proposed feature spaces compared to CC
	feature space. Multiwavelet features show superior detection sensitivity
	compared to the scalar wavelet features.},

	modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme

	taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the
	formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering,
	objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics
	or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that
	tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence

	learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and
	is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich
	history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular

	1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years

	fMRI},
  school = {Ohio State Univ},
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {Understanding the highly complex, spatially distributed and temporally
	
	organized phenomena entailed by mental processes using functional
	MRI is an
	
	important research problem in cognitive and clinical neuroscience.
	Classically,
	
	the analysis of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has focused
	either
	
	on the creation of static maps localizing the metabolic fingerprints
	of neural
	
	processes or on studying their temporal evolution in a few pre-selected
	regions
	
	in the human brain. However, it is widely acknowledged that cognition
	recruits
	
	the entire brain and that the underlying mental processes are fundamentally
	
	spatio-temporal in nature. By neglecting either the temporal dimension
	or the
	
	spatial entirety of brain function, such methods must necessarily
	compromise on
	
	extracting and representing all the information contained in the data.
	
	
	In this thesis, I present new paradigms and an accompanying suite
	of tools to
	
	facilitate a time–resolved exploration of mental processes as captured
	by fMRI.
	
	The first part of the thesis describes a method for visualizing the
	metabolic
	
	activity recorded in the data and a method for studying the timing
	differences
	
	in the recruitment of the different functional modules during a task.
	In the
	
	next part a state-space formalism is used to model the brain transitioning
	
	through a sequence of mental states as it solves a task, enabling
	study of the
	
	spatial distribution of activity along with its temporal structure.
	Efficient
	
	algorithms for estimating the parameters, state-sequence and the hemodynamic
	
	behavior of the brain have been developed. In addition to revealing
	the mental
	
	patterns of an individual subject, such a generative model enables
	comparing
	
	mental processes between subjects in their entirety, not just as spatial
	
	activation maps.
	
	
	The methods developed here were applied to fMRI studies for developmental
	
	disorders such as dyslexia and dyscalculia (i.e. math learning disability)
	and
	
	for visuo-spatial working memory. I show the types of inferences possible
	with
	
	these methods in analyzing and differentiating mental capabilities
	and the
	
	neuro-scientific conclusions that they provide.},

	of artifact is inevitable in data from even the most modern MRI scanners.
	This chapter seeks to highlight the most common distortions and signal
	corruptions that are encountered in MRI data. Some of these artifacts
	can be minimized during acquisition--others may be solved during

	be caused by defects in the receive coil array or the RF amplifiers
	powering it. During a scan, this artifact results in small image
	intensity shifts in parts of the brain imaged by the affected array
	components. These shifts introduce artifactual correlations in RS

	is particularly important in arrays with larger numbers of coils,
	which may generate smaller artifact zones. In such a case, brain-wide
	average noise estimates would fail to capture the artifact. We also
	examine the anatomical structure of artifactual variance in RS FMRI

	and where in the brain are they manifested. We consider current methods
	for reducing confounding sources (or noises) and their effects on
	connectivity maps, and offer an improved approach (ANATICOR) that
	can also reduce hardware artifacts. The methods described herein

	affects the fluctuation amplitude, yet volume registration can distort
	the timing information. In this study, we aimed to systematically
	determine the optimal order of volume registration, slice-time correction
	and RETROICOR in their traditional forms. In addition, we evaluate
	the sensitivity of RETROICOR to timing errors introduced by the slice
	acquisition, and we develop a new method of accounting for timing
	errors introduced by volume registration into physiological correction
	(motion-modified RETROICOR). Both simulation and resting data indicate
	that the temporal standard deviation is reduced most by performing
	volume registration before RETROICOR and slice-time correction after
	RETROCIOR. While simulations indicate that physiological noise correction
	with regressors constructed on a slice-by-slice basis more accurately
	modeled physiological noise compared to using the same regressors
	for the entire volume, the difference between these regression techniques
	in subject data was minimal. The motion-modified RETROICOR showed
	marked improvement in simulations with varying amounts of subject
	motion, reducing the temporal standard deviation by up to 36\% over
	the traditional RETROICOR. Though to a lesser degree than in simulation,
	the motion-modified RETROICOR performed better in nearly every voxel
	in the brain in both high- and low-resolution subject data.},

	by using a suitable regularization. In this paper, we explore two
	possible approaches. The first one is based on structural constraints.
	Especially, post-nonlinear mixtures are an important special case,
	where a nonlinearity is applied to linear mixtures. For such mixtures,
	the ambiguities are essentially the same as for the linear ICA or
	BSS problems. The second approach uses Bayesian inference methods
	for estimating the best statistical parameters, under almost unconstrained
	models in which priors can be easily added. In the later part of
	this paper, various separation techniques proposed for post-nonlinear
	mixtures and general nonlinear mixtures are reviewed.},

	the analysis of event-related potentials (ERP). We place these developments

	measurements of evoked brain responses through the fusion of EEG
	and f{MRI} data. In this paper, we consider some fundamental issues
	when selecting an appropriate statistical model that enables diverse
	questions to be asked of the data and at the same time retains maximum
	sensitivity. The three key issues addressed in this paper are as
	follows: (i) should multivariate or mass univariate analyses be adopted,
	(ii) should time be treated as an experimental factor or as a dimension
	of the measured response variable, and (iii) how to form appropriate
	explanatory variables in a hierarchical observation model. We review
	the relative merits of the different options and explain the rationale
	for our choices. In brief, we motivate a mass univariate approach
	in terms of sensitivity to region-specific responses. This involves
	modeling responses at each voxel or space bin separately. In contradistinction,
	we treat time as an experimental factor to enable inferences about
	temporally distributed responses that encompass multiple time bins.
	In a companion paper, we develop statistical models of ERPs in the
	time domain that follow from the heuristics established here and
	illustrate the approach using simulated and real data.},

	In contradistinction to existing voxel-based univariate or multivariate

	assumptions about the location and spatial smoothness of the blood

	the grey matter surface from an individual's high-resolution T1-weighted

	fit the model parameters for a single time point, using a regularized
	solution, and finally make inferences about the estimated parameters
	over time. Significant effects, induced by the experimental paradigm,
	can then be visualized in the native voxel-space or on the reconstructed
	folded, inflated, or flattened cortical surface. As an example, we
	apply the approach to a f{MRI} study (finger opposition task) and
	compare the results to those of a voxel-based analysis as implemented

	product of coordinated activity in distributed functionally connected
	brain regions. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a data-driven
	approach that can identify temporally coherent networks that underlie
	fMRI activity. We applied ICA to an fMRI dataset for 115 patients
	with chronic schizophrenia and 130 healthy controls by performing
	the Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm. Here, we describe the first
	results using ICA to identify differences in the function of WM networks
	in schizophrenia compared to controls. ICA revealed six networks
	that showed significant differences between patients with schizophrenia
	and healthy controls. Four of these networks were negatively task-correlated
	and showed deactivation across the posterior cingulate, precuneus,
	medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, inferior parietal lobules,
	and parahippocampus. These networks comprise brain regions known
	as the default-mode network (DMN), a well-characterized set of regions
	shown to be active during internal modes of cognition and implicated
	in schizophrenia. Two networks were positively task-correlated, with
	one network engaging WM regions such as bilateral DLPFC and inferior
	parietal lobules while the other network engaged primarily the cerebellum.
	Our results suggest that DLPFC dysfunction in schizophrenia might
	be lateralized to the left and intrinsically tied to other regions
	such as the inferior parietal lobule and cingulate gyrus. Furthermore,
	we found that DMN dysfunction in schizophrenia exists across multiple
	subnetworks of the DMN and that these subnetworks are individually
	relevant to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In summary, this
	large multisite study identified multiple temporally coherent networks,
	which are aberrant in schizophrenia versus healthy controls and suggests
	that both task-correlated and task-anticorrelated networks may serve
	as potential biomarkers.},

	high temporal resolution is possible in principle. However, the temporal
	resolution is limited by a blurred intrinsic hemodynamic response
	and a finite signal-to-noise ratio. To determine the upper limit
	of temporal resolution in a single area during repeated tasks, motor
	cortex activity was investigated during visually instructed finger
	movements. Without averaging, a sequence of four single-finger movements
	with an execution time of approximately 2 s can be resolved when
	the delay time between consecutive sequences is at least 3 s. The
	hemodynamic response time is constant for each subject, but not among
	different subjects. The temporal resolution can be better when the
	signal from spatially distinct regions is examined. For a series
	of experiments involving a visually instructed delayed cued finger
	movement task with a well-defined, independently determined, variable
	delay time, time courses in the motor area are distinct from each
	other in two experiments if the difference in delay time is as little
	as 2 s. The activation in the visual area due to the presentation
	of the task serves here as an internal time reference. By comparing
	a set of f{MRI} time courses in multiple distinct areas, serial neural
	processing may be investigated.},

	(US) can be used to image the region of interest directly and provide

	Unfortunately, real-time US images often have poor signal-to-noise
	ratio and suffer from imaging artefacts. Therefore, registration
	using US images can be challenging and significant preprocessing
	is often required to make the registrations robust. In this paper
	we present a novel technique for computing the image-to-physical
	registration for minimally invasive cardiac interventions using 3-D
	US. Our technique uses knowledge of the physics of the US imaging
	process to reduce the amount of preprocessing required on the 3-D
	US images. To account for the fact that clinical US images normally
	undergo significant image processing before being exported from the
	US machine our optimization scheme allows the parameters of the US
	imaging model to vary. We validated our technique by computing rigid
	registrations for 12 cardiac US/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
	datasets acquired from six volunteers and two patients. The technique
	had mean registration errors of 2.1-4.4 mm, and 75% capture ranges
	of 5-30 mm. We also demonstrate how the same approach can be used
	for respiratory motion correction: on 15 datasets acquired from five
	volunteers the registration errors due to respiratory motion were
	reduced by 45%-92%.},

	classifiers that incorporate weighted sums of basis functions with

	classifiers that scale favorably in both the number of training samples

	learning disability affecting the acquisition of mathematical skills

	of the present study was to examine cerebral mechanisms underlying
	DD. METHODS: Eighteen children with DD aged 11.2 +/- 1.3 years and
	twenty age-matched typically achieving schoolchildren were investigated
	using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during trials
	testing approximate and exact mathematical calculation, as well as
	magnitude comparison. RESULTS: Children with DD showed greater inter-individual
	variability and had weaker activation in almost the entire neuronal
	network for approximate calculation including the intraparietal sulcus,
	and the middle and inferior frontal gyrus of both hemispheres. In
	particular, the left intraparietal sulcus, the left inferior frontal
	gyrus and the right middle frontal gyrus seem to play crucial roles
	in correct approximate calculation, since brain activation correlated
	with accuracy rate in these regions. In contrast, no differences
	between groups could be found for exact calculation and magnitude
	comparison. In general, fMRI revealed similar parietal and prefrontal
	activation patterns in DD children compared to controls for all conditions.
	CONCLUSION: In conclusion, there is evidence for a deficient recruitment
	of neural resources in children with DD when processing analog magnitudes
	of numbers.},

	A series of images were acquired continuously with the same imaging

  abstract = {Echo-planar imaging (EPI) is a fast nuclear magnetic resonance imaging
	(MRI) method. Unfortunately, local magnetic field inhomogeneities
	induced mainly by the subject's presence cause significant geometrical
	distortion, predominantly along the phase-encoding direction, which
	must be undone to allow for meaningful further processing. So far,
	this aspect has been too often neglected. In this paper, we suggest
	a new approach using an algorithm specifically developed for the
	automatic registration of distorted EPI images with corresponding
	anatomically correct MRI images. We model the deformation field with
	splines, which gives us a great deal of flexibility, while comprising
	the affine transform as a special case. The registration criterion
	is least squares. Interestingly, the complexity of its evaluation
	does not depend on the resolution of the control grid. The spline
	model gives us good accuracy thanks to its high approximation order.
	The short support of splines leads to a fast algorithm. A multiresolution
	approach yields robustness and additional speedup. The algorithm
	was tested on real as well as synthetic data, and the results were
	compared with a manual method. A wavelet-based Sobolev-type random
	deformation generator was developed for testing purposes. A blind
	test indicates that the proposed automatic method is faster, more
	reliable, and more precise than the manual one.},

	different from spatially localized real-time implementations, since
	it does not require prior assumptions about functional localization
	and individual performance strategies, and has the ability to provide
	feedback based on intuitive translations of brain state rather than
	localized fluctuations. Thus this approach provides the capability
	for a new class of experimental designs in which real-time feedback
	control of the stimulus is possible-rather than using a fixed paradigm,
	experiments can adaptively evolve as subjects receive brain-state
	feedback. In this report, we describe our implementation and characterize
	its performance capabilities. We observed approximately 80\% classification
	accuracy using whole brain, block-design, motor data. Within both
	left and right motor task conditions, important differences exist
	between the initial transient period produced by task switching (changing
	between rapid left or right index finger button presses) and the
	subsequent stable period during sustained activity. Further analysis
	revealed that very high accuracy is achievable during stable task
	periods, and that the responsiveness of the classifier to changes
	in task condition can be much faster than signal time-to-peak rates.
	Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of this implementation with
	respect to behavioral task, suggesting that our results are applicable
	across a spectrum of cognitive domains. Beyond basic research, this
	technology can complement electroencephalography-based brain computer
	interface research, and has potential applications in the areas of
	biofeedback rehabilitation, lie detection, learning studies, virtual

  abstract = {An automated coordinate-based system to retrieve brain labels from
	the 1988 Talairach Atlas, called the Talairach Daemon (TD), was previously
	introduced [Lancaster et al., 1997]. In the present study, the TD
	system and its 3-D database of labels for the 1988 Talairach atlas
	were tested for labeling of functional activation foci. TD system
	labels were compared with author-designated labels of activation
	coordinates from over 250 published functional brain-mapping studies
	and with manual atlas-derived labels from an expert group using a
	subset of these activation coordinates. Automated labeling by the
	TD system compared well with authors' labels, with a 70\% or greater
	label match averaged over all locations. Author-label matching improved
	to greater than 90\% within a search range of +/-5 mm for most sites.
	An adaptive grey matter (GM) range-search utility was evaluated using
	individual activations from the M1 mouth region (30 subjects, 52
	sites). It provided an 87\% label match to Brodmann area labels (BA
	4 & BA 6) within a search range of +/-5 mm. Using the adaptive GM
	range search, the TD system's overall match with authors' labels
	(90\%) was better than that of the expert group (80\%). When used
	in concert with authors' deeper knowledge of an experiment, the TD
	system provides consistent and comprehensive labels for brain activation
	foci. Additional suggested applications of the TD system include
	interactive labeling, anatomical grouping of activation foci, lesion-deficit
	analysis, and neuroanatomy education.},

  abstract = {One of the most intriguing questions facing modern science is the
	inner workings of the human brain. Functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (f{MRI}) is a powerful tool used to study the human brain
	in action. The data produced from mapping the active processes within
	the brain present many challenges to statisticians, computer scientists,
	engineers and other data analysts, due to their complex structure
	and the ever-increasing sophistication of the scientific questions
	being posed by researchers. This book represents the first in-depth
	discussion of statistical methodology, which it couples with an introduction
	to the scientific background needed to understand the data.
	
	 Starting from the basic science - where f{MRI} data come from, why
	they are so complicated, and the role statistics can play in designing
	and interpreting experiments - the book gives a detailed survey of
	the numerous methods that have been applied in the last fifteen years.
	The analysis of f{MRI} data features many of the major issues of
	concern in modern statistics, such as high dimensionality, multiple
	testing, and visualization. The array of techniques examined in the
	book ranges from the simple two-sample t-test and the general linear
	model to hierarchical spatiotemporal models, multivariate methods
	such as principal components analysis, and Bayesian approaches as
	they have been used in f{MRI}. Software, including descriptions of
	the most popular freeware packages and their capabilities, is also
	discussed. This book offers researchers who are interested in the
	analysis of f{MRI} data a detailed discussion from a statistical
	perspective that covers the entire process from data collection to
	the graphical presentation of results. The book is a valuable resource
	for statisticians who want to learn more about this growing field,
	and for neuroscientists who want to learn more about how their data
	can be analyzed.},

	based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using blood

	whether BOLD signals in a particular region can be caused by activation
	of local excitatory neurons. This difficult question is central to
	the interpretation and utility of BOLD, with major significance for
	fMRI studies in basic research and clinical applications. Using a
	novel integrated technology unifying optogenetic control of inputs

	cell types defined not only by genetic identity and cell body location,
	but also by axonal projection target. Finally, we show that of MRI
	within the living and intact mammalian brain reveals BOLD signals
	in downstream targets distant from the stimulus, indicating that
	this approach can be used to map the global effects of controlling
	a local cell population. In this respect, unlike both conventional
	fMRI studies based on correlations and fMRI with electrical stimulation
	that will also directly drive afferent and nearby axons, this of
	MRI approach provides causal information about the global circuits
	recruited by defined local neuronal activity patterns. Together these
	findings provide an empirical foundation for the widely-used fMRI
	BOLD signal, and the features of of MRI define a potent tool that
	may be suitable for functional circuit analysis as well as global
	phenotyping of dysfunctional circuitry.},

	successfully captured activation patterns even when the functional

	hypothesized response. We also showed that IVA effectively inferred

	associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can alter functional
	magnetic resonance (MR) imaging evaluation of language lateralization
	and whether reorganization of language function occurs in patients
	with brain AVMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with left-hemisphere
	brain AVMs and 10 age-matched control subjects were examined with
	1.5-T blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional MR imaging.
	Verbal fluency, sentence repetition, and story listening tasks were
	performed. The functional MR imaging laterality index in the frontal
	and temporal lobes was defined as the (L - R)/(L + R) ratio, where
	L and R are the numbers of activated pixels in the left and right
	hemispheres, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed with
	Wilcoxon signed rank, Fisher exact, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS:
	Control subjects had left-sided language dominance, although symmetric
	pixel counts were observed in the frontal lobes in two subjects and
	in the temporal lobes in one subject. Six patients had left-sided
	language dominance similar to that observed in control subjects.
	Five of these patients had AVMs outside frontal or temporal language
	areas, without flow abnormalities. Five patients had abnormally right-sided
	asymmetric indexes (below mean control subject value - 2 SDs), which
	suggested language reorganization (P <.05). Results of Wada examination
	and/or postembolization functional MR imaging performed in two of
	these patients showed that the abnormal laterality indexes were at
	least partly due to severe flow abnormalities that impaired detection
	of BOLD MR imaging signal intensity. CONCLUSION: These data suggest
	that flow abnormalities may interfere with language lateralization
	assessment with functional MR imaging.},

  abstract = { During the past decade, the applicability of hidden Markov models
	(HMM) to various facets of speech analysis had been demonstrated
	in several different experiments. These investigations all rest on
	the assumption that speech is a quasi-stationary process whose stationary
	intervals can be identified with the occupancy of a single state
	of an appropriate HMM. In the traditional form of the HMM, the probability
	of duration of a state decreases exponentially with time. This behavior
	does not provide an adequate representation of the temporal structure
	of speech. The solution proposed here is to replace the probability
	distributions of duration with continuous probability density functions
	to form a continuously variable duration hidden Markov model (CVDHMM).
	The gamma distribution is ideally suited to specification of the
	durational density since it is one-sided and has only two parameters
	which, together, define both mean and variance. The main result is
	a derivation and proof of convergence of reestimation formulae for
	all the parameters of the CVDHMM. It is interesting to note that
	if the state durations are gamma distributed, one of the formulae
	is nonalgebraic but, fortuitously, has properties such that it is
	easily and rapidly solved numerically to any desired degree of accuracy.
	Other results are presented including the performance of the formulae
	on simulated data.}

	Differences in intensity inhomogeneity between serial scans can confound

	registration and makes both manual and automated segmentation of
	tissue type less reliable. A technique is described for the correction
	of this differential bias that makes no assumptions about signal
	distribution, bias field or signal homogeneity. Instead, the bias
	field calculation is performed on the basis that the remaining structure
	in the difference image of registered serial scans has small-scale
	structure. The differential bias field is of much larger scale and
	can thus be obtained by applying an appropriate filter to the difference
	image. The serial scan pair is then corrected for the differential
	bias field and atrophy measurement can be performed on the corrected
	scan pair. Application of a known, simulated bias field to real serial
	MR images was shown to alter atrophy measurements significantly.
	The differential correction method recovered the applied differential
	bias field and thereby improved atrophy measurements. This method
	was then applied to serial imaging in patients with dementia using
	a set of serial scan pairs with visually identified, significant
	differential bias and a set of scan pairs with negligible differential
	bias. Differential bias correction specifically reduced the variance

	dimensionality and high noise level of the f{MRI} data, order selection,
	i.e., estimation of the number of informative components, is critical
	to reduce over/underfitting in such methods. Dependence among f{MRI}
	data samples in the spatial and temporal domain limits the usefulness
	of the practical formulations of information-theoretic criteria (ITC)
	for order selection, since they are based on likelihood of independent

  abstract = {A three-dimensional image registration method for motion correction
	of functional magnetic resonance imaging (f{MRI}) time-series, based
	on independent component analysis (ICA), is described. We argue that
	movement during f{MRI} data acquisition results in a simultaneous
	increase in the joint entropy of the observed time-series and a decrease
	in the joint entropy of a nonlinear function of the derived spatially
	independent components calculated by ICA. We propose this entropy
	difference as a reliable criterion for motion correction and refer
	to a method that maximizes this as motion-corrected ICA (MCICA).
	Specifically, a given motion-corrupted volume may be corrected by
	determining the linear combination of spatial transformations of
	the motion-corrupted volume that maximizes the proposed criterion.
	In essence, MCICA consists of designing an adaptive spatial resampling
	filter which maintains maximum temporal independence among the recovered
	components. In contrast with conventional registration methods, MCICA
	does not require registration of motion-corrupted volumes to a single
	reference volume which can introduce artifacts because corrections
	are applied without accounting for variability due to the task-related
	activation. Simulations demonstrate that MCICA is robust to activation
	level, additive noise, random motion in the reference volumes and
	the exact number of independent components extracted. When the method
	was applied to real data with minimal estimated motion, the method
	had little effect and, hence, did not introduce spurious changes
	in the data. However, in a data series from a motor f{MRI} experiment
	with larger motion, preprocessing the data with the proposed method
	resulted in the emergence of activation in primary motor and supplementary
	motor cortices. Although mutual information (MI) was not explicitly
	optimized, the MI between all subsequent volumes and the first one
	was consistently increased for all volumes after preprocessing the
	data with MCICA. We suggest MCICA represents a robust and reliable
	method for preprocessing of f{MRI} time-series corrupted with motion.},

	limits the temporal resolution, which makes it difficult to unambiguously
	identify possible fast nonhemodynamic changes. In this paper we propose
	a novel reconstruction approach, called dynamic inverse imaging (InI),
	that is capable of providing millisecond temporal resolution when
	highly parallel detection is used. To achieve an order-of-magnitude
	speedup in generating time-resolved contrast estimates and dynamic
	statistical parametric maps (dSPMs), the spatial information is derived
	from an array of detectors rather than by time-consuming gradient-encoding
	methods. The InI approach was inspired by electroencephalography
	(EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) source localization techniques.
	Dynamic MR InI was evaluated by means of numerical simulations. InI
	was also applied to measure BOLD hemodynamic time curves at 20-ms
	temporal resolution in a visual stimulation experiment using a 90-channel
	head array. InI is expected to improve the time resolution of MRI
	and provide increased flexibility in the trade-off between spatial

	Three components of interest including two task-related components

	is often modeled using a linear time invariant (LTI) system, where

	an estimated or assumed hemodynamic response function (HRF) is the

	by discussing a variety of linear and non-linear techniques for estimating
	the HRF. For each method, we introduce techniques for estimating
	amplitude, peak latency, and duration and for performing inference
	in a multi-subject f{MRI} setting. We then assess each technique's
	relative sensitivity and its propensity for mis-attributing task
	effects on one parameter (e.g., duration) to another (e.g., amplitude).
	Finally, we introduce methods for quantifying model misspecification

	Overall, the results show that it is surprisingly difficult to accurately
	recover true task-evoked changes in BOLD signal, and that there are
	substantial differences among models in terms of power, bias and

	to image blood dynamics through the entire brain with a high spatial
	resolution. However, the temporal resolution is much slower than
	the underlying neuronal activity one seeks to infer. Recent developments
	in rapid imaging allow 3D fMRI studies to be performed at a temporal
	resolution of 100 ms; a 10-fold increase compared to standard approaches.
	This increase in temporal resolution offers a number of potential
	benefits. First, it allows the focus of analysis to be shifted from
	changes in blood flow taking place 5-8 s after neuronal activity
	to more transient changes taking place immediately following activation.
	We argue that studying these changes provides valuable information
	about the relative timing of activation across different regions
	of the brain, which is crucial for inferring brain pathways. Second,
	rapid imaging allows for the efficient modeling of physiological
	artifacts without problems with aliasing; something that is difficult
	at standard resolutions. We illustrate how removal of these artifacts
	provides the increase in signal-to-noise ratio required for studying
	the subtle changes in oxygenation we are interested in. Finally,
	we show how high temporal resolution data provides the opportunity
	to focus the analysis on the rate of change in oxygenation rather
	than the level of oxygenation as is the current practice. The price
	of performing rapid imaging studies is a decrease in spatial resolution.
	However, we argue that the resolution is still comparable to the

	responses of VASO-f{MRI}, cerebral blood flow (CBF)-based f{MRI},

	the purely analytical character of an optimization problem, expressed
	perhaps by properties of the necessary conditions, and the behavior
	of algorithms used to solve a problem. This was a major theme of
	the first edition of this book and the second edition expands and

	covers the central concepts of practical optimization techniques.
	It is designed for either self-study by professionals or classroom
	work at the undergraduate or graduate level for technical students.

	subdivision is used to delineate regions of interest. The mask values
	in these subdivided regions are used as a measure of information
	content. Later, another wavelet transform is conducted within each
	subdivided region and the coefficients are sorted based on a perceptual

	The increase of relative cerebral blood flow after stimulus onset

	rCBV exhibited two distinct and nearly sequential processes after

	was not statistically different from the time constant for relative

	the modification of the original formulation of this vessel filter,
	such that it becomes a smooth function on its domain which is a necessary
	condition imposed by the diffusion process to ensure well-posedness.
	The second contribution concerns the application of noise filtering

  abstract = {We review some of the progress made in understanding the nature of
	functional specialization in the human brain, beginning with the
	anatomical claim that all mental faculties have their own distinct
	material substrate in different regions of the brain and the psychological
	claim that each mental faculty is characterized by the content domain
	with which it deals. This conceptual framework led behavioral neurologists
	to show how discrete brain lesions provoked different types of language,
	praxic, gnostic, spatial, and memory disorders. The simplest way
	of interpreting these anatomoclinical associations was to conjecture
	that the normal function (now impaired by brain damage) was localized
	within that lesioned region. It was also realized that cognitive
	impairments could arise from lesions that spared the functional centers
	themselves but disconnected them from other centers. Nonetheless,
	many neuroscientists remained skeptical of the entire paradigm. Accordingly,
	in the late 19th century functional localization began to be studied
	in the intact human brain by such techniques as measuring the temperature
	of different brain regions when different cognitive tasks were performed.
	During the 20th century these crude techniques gave way to positron
	emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetoencephalography.
	The relatively precise spatial and temporal resolution of modern
	methods now raises a crucial question: Do the functional localizations
	obtained by the anatomoclinical method converge with those implied

  abstract = {We present a general method for the classification of independent
	components (ICs) extracted from functional MRI (f{MRI}) data sets.
	The method consists of two steps. In the first step, each f{MRI}-IC
	is associated with an IC-fingerprint, i.e., a representation of the
	component in a multidimensional space of parameters. These parameters
	are post hoc estimates of global properties of the ICs and are largely
	independent of a specific experimental design and stimulus timing.
	In the second step a machine learning algorithm automatically separates
	the IC-fingerprints into six general classes after preliminary training
	performed on a small subset of expert-labeled components. We illustrate
	this approach in a multisubject f{MRI} study employing visual structure-from-motion
	stimuli encoding faces and control random shapes. We show that: (1)
	IC-fingerprints are a valuable tool for the inspection, characterization
	and selection of f{MRI}-ICs and (2) automatic classifications of
	f{MRI}-ICs in new subjects present a high correspondence with those
	obtained by expert visual inspection of the components. Importantly,
	our classification procedure highlights several neurophysiologically
	interesting processes. The most intriguing of which is reflected,
	with high intra- and inter-subject reproducibility, in one IC exhibiting
	a transiently task-related activation in the 'face' region of the
	primary sensorimotor cortex. This suggests that in addition to or
	as part of the mirror system, somatotopic regions of the sensorimotor
	cortex are involved in disambiguating the perception of a moving
	body part. Finally, we show that the same classification algorithm
	can be successfully applied, without re-training, to f{MRI} collected
	using acquisition parameters, stimulation modality and timing considerably
	different from those used for training.},

  abstract = {In functional brain mapping, pattern recognition methods allow detecting
	multivoxel patterns of brain activation which are informative with
	respect to a subject's perceptual or cognitive state. The sensitivity
	of these methods, however, is greatly reduced when the proportion
	of voxels that convey the discriminative information is small compared
	to the total number of measured voxels. To reduce this dimensionality
	problem, previous studies employed univariate voxel selection or
	region-of-interest-based strategies as a preceding step to the application
	of machine learning algorithms. Here we employ a strategy for classifying
	functional imaging data based on a multivariate feature selection
	algorithm, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) that uses the training
	algorithm (support vector machine) recursively to eliminate irrelevant
	voxels and estimate informative spatial patterns. Generalization
	performances on test data increases while features/voxels are pruned
	based on their discrimination ability. In this article we evaluate
	RFE in terms of sensitivity of discriminative maps (Receiver Operative
	Characteristic analysis) and generalization performances and compare
	it to previously used univariate voxel selection strategies based
	on activation and discrimination measures. Using simulated f{MRI}
	data, we show that the recursive approach is suitable for mapping
	discriminative patterns and that the combination of an initial univariate
	activation-based (F-test) reduction of voxels and multivariate recursive
	feature elimination produces the best results, especially when differences
	between conditions have a low contrast-to-noise ratio. Furthermore,
	we apply our method to high resolution (2 x 2 x 2 mm(3)) data from
	an auditory f{MRI} experiment in which subjects were stimulated with
	sounds from four different categories. With these real data, our
	recursive algorithm proves able to detect and accurately classify
	multivoxel spatial patterns, highlighting the role of the superior
	temporal gyrus in encoding the information of sound categories. In
	line with the simulation results, our method outperforms univariate
	statistical analysis and statistical learning without feature selection.},

  abstract = {Pattern classification in functional MRI (f{MRI}) is a novel methodology
	to automatically identify differences in distributed neural substrates
	resulting from cognitive tasks. Reliable pattern classification is
	challenging due to the high dimensionality of f{MRI} data, the small
	number of available data sets, interindividual differences, and dependence
	on the acquisition methodology. Thus, most previous f{MRI} classification
	methods were applied in individual subjects. In this study, we developed
	a novel approach to improve multiclass classification across groups
	of subjects, field strengths, and f{MRI} methods. Spatially normalized
	activation maps were segmented into functional areas using a neuroanatomical
	atlas and each map was classified separately using local classifiers.
	A single multiclass output was applied using a weighted aggregation
	of the classifier's outputs. An Adaboost technique was applied, modified
	to find the optimal aggregation of a set of spatially distributed
	classifiers. This Adaboost combined the region-specific classifiers
	to achieve improved classification accuracy with respect to conventional
	techniques. Multiclass classification accuracy was assessed in an
	f{MRI} group study with interleaved motor, visual, auditory, and
	cognitive task design. Data were acquired across 18 subjects at different
	field strengths (1.5 T, 4 T), with different pulse sequence parameters
	(voxel size and readout bandwidth). Misclassification rates of the
	boosted classifier were between 3.5\% and 10\%, whereas for the single
	classifier, these were between 15\% and 23\%, suggesting that the
	boosted classifier provides a better generalization ability together
	with better robustness. The high computational speed of boosting
	classification makes it attractive for real-time f{MRI} to facilitate
	online interpretation of dynamically changing activation patterns.},

	i.e., that the potential variability of response between sessions
	is negligible. The present study sought to examine this assumption
	empirically. A total of 99 sessions, comprising 33 repeats of simple
	motor, visual, and cognitive paradigms, were collected over a period
	of 2 months on a single male subject. For each paradigm, the inclusion
	of session-by-condition interactions explained a significant amount
	of error variance (P < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons) over
	a model assuming a common activation magnitude across all sessions.
	However, many of those voxels displaying significant session-by-condition
	interactions were not seen in a multisession fixed-effects analysis
	of the same data set; i.e., they were not activated on average across
	all sessions. Most voxels that were both significantly variable and
	activated on average across all sessions did not survive a random-effects
	analysis (modeling between-session variance). We interpret our results
	as demonstrating that correct inference about subject responses to
	activation tasks can be derived through the use of a statistical
	model which accounts for both within- and between-session variance,
	combined with an appropriately large session sample size. If researchers
	have access to only a single session from a single subject, erroneous
	conclusions are a possibility, in that responses specific to this
	single session may be claimed to be typical responses for this subject.},

	and interregional correlations among human cortical areas during
	performance of an object vision (face matching) and spatial vision
	(dot-location matching) task. Brain areas for the network were selected
	based on regions showing significant rCBF or interregional correlations
	between tasks. Anterior temporal and frontal lobe regions were added
	to the network using a principal components analysis. Interactions
	among selected regions were quantified with structural equation modeling.
	In the structural equation models, connections between brain areas
	were based on known neuroanatomy and the interregional correlations
	were used to calculate path coefficients representing the magnitude
	of the influence of each directional path. The combination of the
	anatomical network and interregional correlations created a functional
	network for each task. The functional network for the right hemisphere
	showed that in the object vision task, dominant path influences were
	among occipitotemporal areas, while in the spatial vision task, occipitoparietal
	interactions were stronger. The network for the spatial vision task
	also had a strong feedback path from area 46 to occipital cortex,
	an effect that was absent in the object vision task. There were strong
	interactions between dorsal and ventral pathways in both networks.
	Functional networks for the left hemisphere did not differ between
	tasks. Networks for the interhemispheric interactions showed that
	the dominant pathway in the right hemisphere also had stronger effects
	on homologous left hemisphere areas and are consistent with a hypothesis
	that intrahemispheric interactions were greater in the right hemisphere
	in both tasks, and that these influences were transmitted callosally
	to the left hemisphere.},

  abstract = {f{MRI} data are commonly analyzed by testing the time course from
	each voxel against specific hypothesized waveforms, despite the fact
	that many components of f{MRI} signals are difficult to specify explicitly.
	In contrast, purely data-driven techniques, by focusing on the intrinsic
	structure of the data, lack a direct means to test hypotheses of
	interest to the examiner. Between these two extremes, there is a
	role for hybrid methods that use powerful data-driven techniques
	to fully characterize the data, but also use some a priori hypotheses
	to guide the analysis. Here we describe such a hybrid technique,
	HYBICA, which uses the initial characterization of the f{MRI} data
	from Independent Component Analysis and allows the experimenter to
	sequentially combine assumed task-related components so that one
	can gracefully navigate from a fully data-derived approach to a fully
	hypothesis-driven approach. We describe the results of testing the
	method with two artificial and two real data sets. A metric based
	on the diagnostic Predicted Sum of Squares statistic was used to
	select the best number of spatially independent components to combine
	and utilize in a standard regressional framework. The proposed metric
	provided an objective method to determine whether a more data-driven
	or a more hypothesis-driven approach was appropriate, depending on
	the degree of mismatch between the hypothesized reference function
	and the features in the data. HYBICA provides a robust way to combine
	the data-derived independent components into a data-derived activation
	waveform and suitable confounds so that standard statistical analysis
	can be performed.},

	based on the independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm of Bell
	and Sejnowski ([1995]: Neural Comput 7:1129-1159). We decomposed
	eight f{MRI} data sets from 4 normal subjects performing Stroop color-naming,
	the Brown and Peterson work/number task, and control tasks into spatially
	independent components. Each component consisted of voxel values
	at fixed three-dimensional locations (a component "map"), and a unique
	associated time course of activation. Given data from 144 time points
	collected during a 6-min trial, ICA extracted an equal number of
	spatially independent components. In all eight trials, ICA derived
	one and only one component with a time course closely matching the
	time course of 40-sec alternations between experimental and control
	tasks. The regions of maximum activity in these consistently task-related
	components generally overlapped active regions detected by standard
	correlational analysis, but included frontal regions not detected
	by correlation. Time courses of other ICA components were transiently
	task-related, quasiperiodic, or slowly varying. By utilizing higher-order
	statistics to enforce successively stricter criteria for spatial
	independence between component maps, both the ICA algorithm and a
	related fourth-order decomposition technique (Comon [1994]: Signal
	Processing 36:11-20) were superior to principal component analysis
	(PCA) in determining the spatial and temporal extent of task-related
	activation. For each subject, the time courses and active regions
	of the task-related ICA components were consistent across trials
	and were robust to the addition of simulated noise. Simulated movement
	artifact and simulated task-related activations added to actual f{MRI}
	data were clearly separated by the algorithm. ICA can be used to
	distinguish between nontask-related signal components, movements,
	and other artifacts, as well as consistently or transiently task-related
	f{MRI} activations, based on only weak assumptions about their spatial
	distributions and without a priori assumptions about their time courses.
	ICA appears to be a highly promising method for the analysis of f{MRI}
	data from normal and clinical populations, especially for uncovering
	unpredictable transient patterns of brain activity associated with
	performance of psychomotor tasks.},

	f{MRI} design, there is a greater need to assess the implications
	of averaging raw f{MRI} data. Selective averaging assumes that the
	f{MRI} signal consists of task-dependent signal, random noise, and
	non-task dependent brain signal that can be modeled as random noise
	so that it tends to zero when averaged over a practical number of
	trials. We recorded a total of four f{MRI} data series from two normal
	subjects (subject 1, axially acquired; subject 2, coronally acquired)
	performing a simple visual event-related task and a water phantom
	with the same f{MRI} scanner imaging parameters. To determine which
	fraction of the f{MRI} data was deterministic as opposed to random,
	we created different data subsets by taking the odd or even time
	points of the full data sets. All data sets were first dimension-reduced
	with principal component analysis (PCA) and separated into 100 spatially
	independent components with independent component analysis (ICA).
	The mutual information between best-matching pairs of components
	selected from full data set-subset comparisons was plotted for each
	data set. Visual inspection suggested that 45-85 components were
	reproducible, and hence deterministic, accounting for 79-97\% of
	the variance, respectively, in the raw data. The reproducible components
	exhibited much less trial-to-trial variability than the raw data
	from even the most activated voxel. Many (22-47) of reproducible
	components were significantly affected by stimulus presentation (P
	< 0.001). The most significantly-stimulus-correlated component was
	strongly time-locked to stimulus presentation and was directly stimulus
	correlated, corresponding to occipital brain regions. However, other
	spatially distinct task-related components demonstrated variable
	temporal relationships with the most significantly-stimulus-correlated
	component. Our results suggest that the majority of the variance
	in f{MRI} data is in fact deterministic, and support the notion that
	the data consist of differing components with differing temporal
	relationships to visual stimulation. They further suggest roles for
	restricting interpretations of the spatial extent of activation from
	event-related designs to a specific region of interest (ROI) and/or
	first separating the data into spatially independent components.
	Averaging the time courses of spatially independent components time-locked
	to stimulus presentation may prevent possible biases in the estimates
	of the spatial and temporal extent of stimulus-correlated activation
	and of trial-to-trial variability.},

	the Balloon/Windkessel model of nonlinear coupling between rCBF and
	BOLD signals, and (ii) a linear model of how regional flow changes
	with synaptic activity. In the present investigation, the input-state-output
	model was used to explore the dependence of simulated PET (rCBF)
	and f{MRI} (BOLD) signals on various parameters pertaining to experimental
	design. Biophysical simulations were used to estimate rCBF and BOLD
	responses as functions of (a) a prior stimulus, (b) epoch length
	(for a fixed SOA), (c) SOA (for a fixed number of events), and (d)
	stimulus amplitude. We also addressed the notion that a single neuronal
	response may differ, in terms of the relative contributions of early
	and late neural components, and investigated the effect of (e) the
	relative size of the late or "endogenous" neural component. We were
	interested in the estimated average rCBF and BOLD responses per stimulus
	or event, not in the statistical efficiency with which these responses
	are detected. The BOLD response was underestimated relative to rCBF
	with a preceding stimulus, increasing epoch length, and increasing
	SOA. Furthermore, the BOLD response showed some highly nonlinear
	behaviour when varying stimulus amplitude, suggesting some form of
	hemodynamic "rectification." Finally, the BOLD response was underestimated
	in the context of large late neuronal components. The difference
	between rCBF and BOLD is attributed to the nonlinear transduction
	of rCBF to BOLD signal. Our simulations support the idea that varying
	parameters that specify the experimental design may have differential
	effects in PET and f{MRI}. Moreover, they show that f{MRI} can be
	asymmetric in its ability to detect deactivations relative to activations
	when an absolute baseline is stipulated. Finally, our simulations
	suggest that relative insensitivity to BOLD signal in specific regions,
	such as the temporal lobe, may be partly explained by higher cognitive
	functions eliciting a relatively large late endogenous neuronal component.},

	that combines wavelet-based methods with the general linear model.
	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ruttimann et al. (1) developed a wavelet-based
	statistical procedure to test wavelet-space partitions for significant
	wavelet coefficients. Their method is applicable for the detection
	of differences between images acquired under two experimental conditions
	using long blocks of stimulation. However, many neuropsychological
	questions require more complicated event-related paradigms and more
	experimental conditions. Therefore, in order to apply wavelet-based
	methods to a wide range of experiments, we present a new approach
	that is based on the general linear model and wavelet thresholding.
	RESULTS: In contrast to a monoresolution filter, the application
	of the wavelet method increased the SNR and showed a set of clearly
	dissociable activations. Furthermore, no relevant decrease of the
	local maxima was observed. CONCLUSION: Wavelet-based methods can
	increase the SNR without diminishing the signal amplitude, while
	preserving the spatial resolution of the image. The anatomical localization
	is strongly improved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The time course of cortical activations of
	different anatomic areas has been demonstrated to reflect, to some
	degree, the temporal dynamics of the brain network. The purpose of
	this study was to determine the temporal sequence of the hemodynamic
	response in the visual, supplemental motor (SMA), and primary motor
	cortical areas by using a visuomotor reaction time task. METHODS:
	The reaction times (RTs) of 26 right-handed subjects were recorded
	in response to a visual cue during an event-related functional MR
	imaging (f{MRI}) experiment. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM99)
	was used, and activation maps were produced for each subject. This
	was followed by a random-effects group analysis. Using a weighted
	least-squares approach, we recorded the time at onset of the hemodynamic
	response of the f{MRI} activation in four regions of interest: the
	right occipital (RO) and left occipital (LO) visual cortices, the
	SMA, and the left sensorimotor area (LM1). Linear regression analysis
	was done between the RTs and the mean latencies for the four areas.
	RESULTS: Using the group analysis, the results showed that the first
	regions to activate were the visual occipital cortices (RO and LO)
	with mean latency +/- standard error of mean (SEM) of 1.74 +/- 0.05
	s and 1.85 +/- 0.08 s, respectively. The visual occipital areas were
	followed by the {SMA} of 2.07 +/- 0.16 s and finally the LM1 with
	a mean latency of 2.1 +/- 0.15 s. There were significant differences
	in the mean onset of latencies between RO and LO, RO and SMA, and
	RO and LM1 (P <.05). On performing regression analysis between the
	RTs and the mean latencies by using the group analysis, there was
	no significant correlation with any of the four areas. By using an
	individual subject analysis, the results again showed that the first
	regions to activate were the visual occipital cortices (RO and LO)
	with mean latency +/- SEM of 1.75 +/- 0.06 s and 1.84 +/- 0.12 s,
	respectively, followed by the {SMA} with a mean latency of 2.19 +/-
	0.25 s and finally the LM1 of 2.26 +/- 0.38 s. There was no significant
	difference between the mean onset latencies. CONCLUSION: The onset
	of the hemodynamic response started first in the visual cortex (input)
	followed by the {SMA} and primary motor cortical area (output). The
	onset of activation showed no direct correlation with the overall
	RTs of the subjects, leading one to suggest that the peripheral motor
	unit may have a greater impact on RT than the central contribution.},

  abstract = {A major impetus in functional MRI development is to enhance sensitivity
	to changes in neural activity. One way to improve sensitivity is
	to enhance contrast to noise ratio, for instance by increasing field
	strength or the number of receiving coils. If these parameters are
	fixed, there is still the possibility to optimize scans by altering
	speed or signal strength [signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)]. We here demonstrate
	a very fast whole-brain scan, by combining a three-dimensional (3D)-PRESTO
	(principle of echo shifting with a train of observations) pulse sequence
	with a commercial eight-channel head coil and sensitivity encoding
	(SENSE). 3D-PRESTO uses time optimally by means of echo shifting.
	Moreover, 3D scans can accommodate SENSE in two directions, reducing
	scan time proportionally. The present PRESTO-SENSE sequence achieves
	full brain coverage within 500 ms. We compared this with a two-dimensional
	(2D) echo planar imaging (EPI) scan with identical brain coverage
	on 10 volunteers. Resting-state temporal SNR in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent
	(BOLD) frequency range and T-statistics for thumb movement and visual
	checkerboard activations were compared. Results show improved temporal
	SNR across the brain for PRESTO-SENSE compared with EPI. The percentage
	signal change and relative standard deviation of the noise were smaller
	for PRESTO-SENSE. Sensitivity for brain activation, as reflected
	by T-values, was consistently higher for PRESTO, and this seemed
	to be mainly due to the increased number of observations within a
	fixed time period. We conclude that PRESTO accelerated with SENSE
	in two directions can be more sensitive to BOLD signal changes than
	the widely used 2D-EPI, when a fixed amount of time is available
	for functional MRI scanning.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses applied spatial variations in
	the magnetic field to encode spatial position. Therefore, nonuniformities
	in the main magnetic field can cause image distortions. In order
	to correct the image distortions, it is desirable to simultaneously
	acquire data with a field map in registration. We propose a joint
	estimation (JE) framework with a fast, noniterative approach using
	harmonic retrieval (HR) methods, combined with a multi-echo echo-planar
	imaging (EPI) acquisition. The connection with HR establishes an
	elegant framework to solve the JE problem through a sequence of 1-D
	HR problems in which efficient solutions are available. We also derive
	the condition on the smoothness of the field map in order for HR
	techniques to recover the image with high signal-to-noise ratio.
	Compared to other dynamic field mapping methods, this method is not
	constrained by the absolute level of the field inhomogeneity over
	the slice, but relies on a generous pixel-to-pixel smoothness. Moreover,
	this method can recover image, field map, and T2* map simultaneously.},

	the permutation approach readily accounts for the multiple comparisons
	problem implicit in the standard voxel-by-voxel hypothesis testing
	framework. When the appropriate assumptions hold, the nonparametric

	a comparable Statistical Parametric Mapping approach using a general

	designs assessed for population effects, the nonparametric approach
	employing a locally pooled (smoothed) variance estimate can outperform

	dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (f{MRI})?
	This issue is of high significance for understanding brain function
	and for relating animal studies to f{MRI}, yet it is still under
	debate. RESULTS: Here we report data from simultaneous recordings
	of isolated unit activity and LFP by using multiple electrodes in
	the human auditory cortex. We found a wide range of coupling levels
	between the activity of individual neurons and gamma LFP. However,
	this large variability could be predominantly explained (r = 0.66)
	by the degree of firing-rate correlations between neighboring neurons.
	Importantly, this phenomenon occurred during both sensory stimulation
	and spontaneous activity. Concerning the coupling of neuronal activity
	to BOLD f{MRI}, we found that gamma LFP was well coupled to BOLD
	measured across different individuals (r = 0.62). By contrast, the
	coupling of single units to BOLD was highly variable and, again,
	tightly related to interneuronal-firing-rate correlations (r = 0.70).
	CONCLUSIONS: Our results offer a resolution to a central controversy
	regarding the coupling between neurons, LFP, and BOLD signals by
	demonstrating, for the first time, that the coupling of single units
	to the other measures is variable yet it is tightly related to the
	degree of interneuronal correlations in the human auditory cortex.},

	provided by several leading f{MRI} analysis software packages was
	performed, including AFNI, AIR, BrainVoyager, FSL, and SPM2. Comparisons
	were performed using data from typical human studies as well as phantom
	data. The identical reconstruction, preprocessing, and analysis steps
	were used on every data set, except that motion correction was performed
	using various configurations from each software package. Each package
	was studied using default parameters, as well as parameters optimized
	for speed and accuracy. Forty subjects performed a Go/No-go task
	(an event-related design that investigates inhibitory motor response)
	and an N-back task (a block-design paradigm investigating working
	memory). The human data were analyzed by extracting a set of general
	linear model (GLM)-derived activation results and comparing the effect
	of motion correction on thresholded activation cluster size and maximum
	t value. In addition, a series of simulated phantom data sets were
	created with known activation locations, magnitudes, and realistic
	motion. Results from the phantom data indicate that AFNI and SPM2
	yield the most accurate motion estimation parameters, while AFNI's
	interpolation algorithm introduces the least smoothing. AFNI is also
	the fastest of the packages tested. However, these advantages did
	not produce noticeably better activation results in motion-corrected
	data from typical human f{MRI} experiments. Although differences
	in performance between packages were apparent in the human data,
	no single software package produced dramatically better results than
	the others. The "accurate" parameters showed virtually no improvement
	in cluster t values compared to the standard parameters. While the
	"fast" parameters did not result in a substantial increase in speed,
	they did not degrade the cluster results very much either. The phantom
	and human data indicate that motion correction can be a valuable
	step in the data processing chain, yielding improvements of up to
	20\% in the magnitude and up to 100\% in the cluster size of detected
	activations, but the choice of software package does not substantially
	affect this improvement.},

	f{MRI} and electroencephalographic (EEG) studies conducted in a rat
	model with forepaw electrical stimulation. We observed a refractory
	period of neuronal origin in a two-stimuli paradigm: the first stimulation
	pulse suppressed the evoked activity in both EEG and f{MRI} signal
	responding to the subsequent stimulus for a period of several hundred
	milliseconds. When there was an apparent site-site interaction detected
	in the evoked EEG signal induced by two stimuli that were primarily
	targeted to activate two different sites in the brain, f{MRI} also
	displayed signal amplitude modulation because of the interactive
	event. With visual stimulation using two short pulses in the human

	activation maps. Recently, the use of MRF priors has been suggested
	as an alternative regularization approach. However, solving for an
	optimal configuration of the MRF is NP-hard in general. In this work,

	methods. Intuitively speaking, the anatomical evidence increases
	the likelihood of activation in the gray matter and improves spatial

	Validation using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis

  abstract = {In this work an Empirical Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian approach
	to analyse fMRI data is proposed. The Bayesian framework is appealing
	since complex models can be adopted in the analysis both for the
	image and noise model. Here, the noise autocorrelation is taken into
	account by adopting an AutoRegressive model of order one and a versatile
	non-linear model is assumed for the task-related activation. Model
	parameters include the noise variance and autocorrelation, activation
	amplitudes and the hemodynamic response function parameters. These
	are estimated at each voxel from samples of the Posterior Distribution.
	Prior information is included by means of a 4D spatio-temporal model
	for the interaction between neighbouring voxels in space and time.
	The results show that this model can provide smooth estimates from
	low SNR data while important spatial structures in the data can be
	preserved. A simulation study is presented in which the accuracy
	and bias of the estimates are addressed. Furthermore, some results
	on convergence diagnostic of the adopted algorithm are presented.
	To validate the proposed approach a comparison of the results with
	those from a standard GLM analysis, spatial filtering techniques
	and a Variational Bayes approach is provided. This comparison shows
	that our approach outperforms the classical analysis and is consistent
	with other Bayesian techniques. This is investigated further by means
	of the Bayes Factors and the analysis of the residuals. The proposed
	approach applied to Blocked Design and Event Related datasets produced
	reliable maps of activation.},

	be used to guide choices about model structure, both concerning the
	intrinsic connectivity pattern and the contextual modulation of individual

	approaches to modelling effective connectivity from f{MRI} data,
	structural equation models (SEMs) and dynamic causal models (DCMs).
	In common to both approaches are model comparison frameworks in which
	inferences can be made about effective connectivity per se and about
	how that connectivity can be changed by perceptual or cognitive set.
	Underlying the two approaches, however, are two very different generative
	models. In DCM, a distinction is made between the 'neuronal level'
	and the 'hemodynamic level'. Experimental inputs cause changes in
	effective connectivity expressed at the level of neurodynamics, which
	in turn cause changes in the observed hemodynamics. In SEM, changes
	in effective connectivity lead directly to changes in the covariance
	structure of the observed hemodynamics. Because changes in effective
	connectivity in the brain occur at a neuronal level DCM is the preferred
	model for f{MRI} data. This review focuses on the underlying assumptions

	Blood flow is assumed to be regulated by precapillary arterioles,

	innervation of CNS blood vessels terminates near capillaries rather
	than arterioles, and in muscle and brain a dilatory signal propagates
	from vessels near metabolically active cells to precapillary arterioles,
	suggesting that blood flow control is initiated in capillaries. Pericytes,
	which are apposed to CNS capillaries and contain contractile proteins,
	could initiate such signalling. Here we show that pericytes can control
	capillary diameter in whole retina and cerebellar slices. Electrical
	stimulation of retinal pericytes evoked a localized capillary constriction,
	which propagated at approximately 2 microm s(-1) to constrict distant
	pericytes. Superfused ATP in retina or noradrenaline in cerebellum
	resulted in constriction of capillaries by pericytes, and glutamate
	reversed the constriction produced by noradrenaline. Electrical stimulation

	(EPI) or spiral is used to collect a dynamic series of images. These
	techniques are sensitive to changes in resonance frequency which
	can arise from respiration and are more significant at high magnetic
	fields. To decrease the noise from respiration-induced phase and
	frequency fluctuations, a simple correction of the "dynamic off-resonance
	in k-space" (DORK) was developed. The correction uses phase information
	from the center of k-space and a navigator echo and is illustrated
	with dynamic scans of single-shot and segmented EPI and, for the
	first time, spiral imaging of the human brain at 7 T. Image noise
	in the respiratory spectrum was measured with an edge operator. The
	DORK correction significantly reduced respiration-induced noise (image
	shift for EPI, blurring for spiral, ghosting for segmented acquisition).
	While spiral imaging was found to exhibit less noise than EPI before
	correction, the residual noise after the DORK correction was comparable.
	The correction is simple to apply and can correct for other sources
	of frequency drift and fluctuations in dynamic imaging.},

	by the biological point-spread of the hemodynamic signal. The extent
	of this spread is determined by the local vascular distribution and
	by the spatial specificity of blood flow regulation, as well as by
	measurement parameters that (i) alter the relative sensitivity of
	the acquisition to activation-induced hemodynamic changes and (ii)
	determine the image contrast as a function of vessel size. In particular,
	large draining vessels on the cortical surface are a major contributor
	to both the BOLD signal change and to the spatial bias of the BOLD
	activation away from the site of neuronal activity. In this work,
	we introduce a laminar surface-based analysis method and study the
	relationship between spatial localization and activation strength
	as a function of laminar depth by acquiring 1 mm isotropic, single-shot
	EPI at 7 T and sampling the BOLD signal exclusively from the superficial,
	middle, or deep cortical laminae. We show that highly-accelerated
	EPI can limit image distortions to the point where a boundary-based
	registration algorithm accurately aligns the EPI data to the surface
	reconstruction. The spatial spread of the BOLD response tangential
	to the cortical surface was analyzed as a function of cortical depth
	using our surface-based analysis. Although sampling near the pial
	surface provided the highest signal strength, it also introduced
	the most spatial error. Thus, avoiding surface laminae improved spatial
	localization by about 40% at a cost of 36% in z-statistic, implying
	that optimal spatial resolution in functional imaging of the cortex
	can be achieved using anatomically-informed spatial sampling to avoid
	large pial vessels.},

	sensitivity. The downside of high-field f{MRI} using the gradient-echo
	echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) method is that images are typically
	very strongly affected by image distortion and signal loss. It has
	been demonstrated at 1.5 T and 3 T that image artifacts can be reduced
	and functional sensitivity simultaneously increased by the use of
	parallel-accelerated multi-echo EPI. Using sensitivity measurements
	and an activation study with a cognitive Stroop task experiment (N=7)
	we here investigate the potential of this method at 7 T. The main
	findings are: (a) image quality compared to a conventional acquisition
	scheme is drastically improved; (b) according to CNR estimations
	the average BOLD sensitivity increases by 6.1+/-4.3\% and 13.9+/-5.5\%
	for unweighted and CNR-weighted echo summation, respectively; (c)
	both functional signal changes and sensitivity in the multi-echo
	data do not exhibit a pronounced dependence on TE. The consequence
	is that (d) in practice the performance of simple echo summation
	at very high field is comparable to that based on a CNR filter. Finally,
	(e) temporal noise observed in the different echo time courses is
	not strongly correlated, thus explaining why echo summation is advantageous.
	The results at typical spatial resolution show that multi-echo EPI
	acquisition leads to considerable artifact reduction and sensitivity
	gains, making it superior to conventional GE-EPI for f{MRI} at 7

	magnitude. This raises the possibility of a parietal dysfunction
	as a root cause of DD. We show that, in children with pure DD, the
	right intraparietal sulcus is not modulated in response to numerical
	processing demands to the same degree as in typically developing
	children. This finding provides the first direct evidence for a specific

  abstract = {MRI faces fundamental limitations in terms of sensitivity and speed.
	These limitations can be effectively tackled by the transition to
	higher field strengths and parallel imaging technology. Owing to
	largely independent physics, the two approaches can be readily combined.
	Considering the specific advantages and disadvantages of high field
	strength and parallel imaging, it is found that the combination is
	particularly synergistic. In the joint approach, the two concepts
	play different roles. Higher field strength acts as a source of higher
	baseline signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while parallelization acts
	as a means of converting added SNR into a variety of alternative
	benefits. This interplay holds promise for a broad range of clinical
	applications, as recently illustrated by several imaging studies
	at 3 T. As a consequence, clinical MRI at 3 T and higher is expected
	to rely more on parallel acquisition than at lower field strength.
	The specific synergy with parallel imaging may even make 3 T the
	field strength of choice for a range of exams that conventionally
	work best at 1.5 T or less.},

	can be performed by fast Fourier transform (FFT), reducing the complexity
	of data processing to the same order of magnitude as in conventional

	is illustrated by imaging simulations with spiral, radial, and random

	(echo volumar imaging, EVI) in order to acquire high temporal resolution
	volumar functional MRI (f{MRI}) data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An improved
	EVI sequence was associated with parallel acquisition and field of
	view reduction in order to acquire a large brain volume in 200 msec.
	Temporal stability and functional sensitivity were increased through
	optimization of all imaging parameters and Tikhonov regularization
	of parallel reconstruction. Two human volunteers were scanned with
	parallel EVI in a 1.5T whole-body MR system, while submitted to a
	slow event-related auditory paradigm. RESULTS: Thanks to parallel
	acquisition, the EVI volumes display a low level of geometric distortions
	and signal losses. After removal of low-frequency drifts and physiological
	artifacts, activations were detected in the temporal lobes of both
	volunteers and voxelwise hemodynamic response functions (HRF) could
	be computed. On these HRF different habituation behaviors in response
	to sentence repetition could be identified. CONCLUSION: This work
	demonstrates the feasibility of high temporal resolution 3D f{MRI}
	with parallel EVI. Combined with advanced estimation tools, this
	acquisition method should prove useful to measure neural activity
	timing differences or study the nonlinearities and nonstationarities

  abstract = {We propose to use dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) to learn the structure
	of effective brain connectivity from functional MRI data in an exploratory
	manner. In our previous work, we used Bayesian networks (BN) to learn
	the functional structure of the brain (Zheng, X., Rajapakse, J.C.,
	2006. Learning functional structure from fMR images. Neuroimage 31
	(4), 1601-1613). However, BN provides a single snapshot of effective
	connectivity of the entire experiment and therefore is unable to
	accurately capture the temporal characteristics of connectivity.
	Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) use a Markov chain to model f{MRI}
	time-series and thereby determine temporal relationships of interactions
	among brain regions. Experiments on synthetic f{MRI} data demonstrate
	that the performance of DBN is comparable to Granger causality mapping
	(GCM) in determining the structure of linearly connected networks.
	Dynamic Bayesian networks render more accurate and informative brain
	connectivity than earlier methods as connectivity is described in
	complete statistical sense and temporal characteristics of time-series
	are explicitly taken into account. The functional structures inferred
	on two real f{MRI} datasets are consistent with the previous literature
	and more accurate than those discovered by BN. Furthermore, we study
	the effects of hemodynamic noise, scanner noise, inter-scan interval,
	and the variability of hemodynamic parameters on the derived connectivity.},

	inductance, hence zero interaction, and (b) by attaching low input
	impedance preamplifiers to all coils, thus eliminating interference
	among next nearest and more distant neighbors. We derive an algorithm
	for combining the data from the phased array elements to yield an
	image with optimum SNR. Other techniques which are easier to implement
	at the cost of lower SNR are explored. Phased array imaging is demonstrated
	with high resolution (512 x 512, 48-cm FOV, and 32-cm FOV) spin-echo
	images of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Data were acquired from
	four-element linear spine arrays, the first made of 12-cm square
	coils and the second made of 8-cm square coils. When compared with
	images from a single 15 x 30-cm rectangular coil and identical imaging
	parameters, the phased array yields a 2X and 3X higher SNR at the
	depth of the spine (approximately 7 cm).},

  abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (f{MRI}) is widely used to detect
	and delineate regions of the brain that change their level of activation
	in response to specific stimuli and tasks. Simple activation maps
	depict only the average level of engagement of different regions
	within distributed systems. F{MRI} potentially can reveal additional
	information about the degree to which components of large-scale neural
	systems are functionally coupled together to achieve specific tasks.
	In order to better understand how brain regions contribute to functionally
	connected circuits, it is necessary to record activation maps either
	as a function of different conditions, at different times or in different
	subjects. Data obtained under different conditions may then be analyzed
	by a variety of techniques to infer correlations and couplings between
	nodes in networks. Several multivariate statistical methods have
	been adapted and applied to analyze variations within such data.
	An approach of particular interest that is suited to studies of connectivity
	within single subjects makes use of acquisitions of runs of MRI images
	obtained while the brain is in a so-called steady state, either at
	rest (i.e., without any specific stimulus or task) or in a condition
	of continuous activation. Interregional correlations between fluctuations
	of MRI signal potentially reveal functional connectivity. Recent
	studies have established that interregional correlations between
	different components of circuits in each of the visual, language,
	motor and working memory systems can be detected in the resting state.
	Correlations at baseline are changed during the performance of a
	continuous task. In this review, various methods available for assessing
	connectivity are described and evaluated.},

	 ![][1]
	
	
	 ![][2]"Great cookbooks are not just collections of interesting recipes.
	They are, first and foremost, books that tell a story, the story
	of how people lived and cooked at a particular point in time. They
	reveal, to borrow an expression from James Beard, their delights
	and prejudices, their view of the social order, their appetite for
	serving others food that meets the expectations of their social class.
	Food can be anything and everything from fuel to an object of intellectual
	curiosity to full-bore hedonism that transports the mind and body
	far from the dinner table with just one overwhelming bite.
	
	 I started cooking out of an early edition of Joy when I was only
	7 years old. I remember making a basic chocolate cake with 7-minute
	frosting. The cake turned out fine, but the frosting resembled gruel
	and was my introduction to the importance of following a recipe to
	the letter. Evidently my lack of patience and precision had led me
	astray. But after that first brush with culinary failure, \_Joy\_
	led me to many, many successes over the years; more to the point,
	I became enamored of Ms. Rombauer's voice, the matter-of-fact charm
	that led her to suggest "stand facing the stove" as a sensible first
	step in any recipe.
	
	 The amateur but highly evolved enthusiasm that Irma Rombauer brought
	to the world of home cooking was a breath of fresh air after the
	slightly earlier era of culinary dowagers Fannie Farmer, Mrs. Beaton,
	and Marion Harland. To those pillars of culinary wisdom, recipes
	were shorthand for cooks who had spent a lifetime in the kitchen.
	A pie pastry recipe might be written as "make a paste." But Ms. Rombauer
	was there to hold our hands, to put food in a social context and
	give it attitude, energy, and meaning in a world where food was leaping
	past the narrow formality of the Victorian age.
	
	 For all of our worldly knowledge about ingredients and culinary custom,
	few cookbook authors have managed to perfectly capture, without artifice
	or self- conscious chatter, the vernacular of an age. Irma Rombauer
	introduced us to a room in our home--the kitchen--that was to become
	a place of enjoyment, not just one of backbreaking labor. She represented
	the essence of the new American experience, which suggested that
	everything in life could be transformed into pleasure with nothing
	more than the proper attitude. And what better way to celebrate this
	new age than to have a smashing cocktail party with the perfect hors
	d?oeuvres?
	
	 The original \_Joy of Cooking\_ was mind over matter, the perfect
	mix of attitude and function. Even as times have changed, the \_Joy\_
	stands out as a watershed volume, a book that speaks to the very
	heart of who we want to be in the kitchen: producers of our own story,
	directors of the good American life.
	
	 And, according to Ms. Rombauer, all we have to do is take that first
	easy step and "stand facing the stove." **--Christopher Kimball,
	founder and editor of \_Cook's Illustrated\_**
	
	 > <br> ![][3]"I'm often asked to pick my favorite cookbook. Considering
	that there are over 3,000 cookbooks published each year, it's a daunting
	task to try to narrow them down. Speaking as a chef who never went
	to cooking school, I've been enthralled by certain cookbooks, immersing
	myself from cover to cover and learning about exotic cuisines from
	all over the world. But for just plain basic information, both the
	original and revised \_Joy of Cooking\_ are still my bibles. I can't
	tell you how many times my wife Jackie and I have thumbed through
	the stained and broken-backed copy of \_Joy\_ in our home kitchen,
	looking for our favorite angel food cake recipe, our favorite skillet
	corn bread, our favorite fluffy biscuits, and crisp waffles, and

	Voxel-based morphometry analysis with an optimization of spatial

	middle frontal gyri. White matter comparison demonstrates clusters
	with significantly less volume in the left frontal lobe and in the
	right parahippocampal gyrus in dyscalculic children. The decreased
	gray and white matter volumes in the frontoparietal network might
	be the neurological substrate of impaired arithmetic processing skills.

  abstract = {The underlying neural mechanisms of developmental dyscalculia (DD)
	are still far from being clearly understood. Even the behavioral
	processes that generate or influence this heterogeneous disorder
	are a matter of controversy. To date, the few studies examining functional
	brain activation in children with DD mainly focus on number and counting
	related tasks, whereas studies on more general cognitive domains
	that are involved in arithmetical development, such as working memory
	are virtually absent. There are several studies showing a close relationship
	between DD and spatial working memory [Camos, V. (2008). Low working
	memory capacity impedes both efficiency and learning of number transcoding
	in children. Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 99(1), 37-57;

	working memory in normally achieving and subtypes of learning disabled
	children. Child Development, 60(4), 973-980]. The relationship between
	these two mechanisms is still matter of debate, but this study follows
	the assumption that poor spatial working memory capacity may hinder
	the acquisition of spatial number representations in children with
	DD [Geary, D. C. (1993). Mathematical disabilities: Cognitive, neuropsychological,
	and genetic components. Psychological Bulletin, 114(2), 345-362;
	von Aster, M., & Shalev, R. S. (2007). Number development and developmental
	dyscalculia. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 49(11),
	868-873]. Using functional MRI the current study compares brain activity
	associated with spatial working memory processes in 8-10-year-old
	children with DD and normally achieving controls. Both groups showed
	significant spatial working memory related activity in a network
	including occipital and parietal regions. Children with DD showed
	weaker neural activation compared to the control group during a spatial
	working memory task in the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS), the
	right insula and the right inferior frontal lobe. Performance tests
	outside the scanner showed impaired working memory proficiency in
	children with DD. Bringing behavioral performance and neural activity
	together we found significant correlations of right IPS activity
	with performance on the verbal digit span forward and the spatial
	Corsi Block Tapping test. Our findings demonstrate for the first
	time an involvement of spatial working memory processes in the neural
	underpinnings of DD. These poor spatial working memory processes
	may inhibit the formation of spatial number representations (mental
	numberline) as well as the storage and retrieval of arithmetical
	facts.},

	bivariate at each time point. Recently, (Rowe, D.B., Logan, B.R.,
	2004. A complex way to compute fMRI activation. NeuroImage 23 (3),
	1078-1092) introduced an fMRI magnitude activation model that utilized
	both the real and imaginary data in each voxel. This model, following
	traditional beliefs, specified that the phase time course were fixed
	unknown quantities which may be estimated voxel-by-voxel. Subsequently,
	(Rowe, D.B., Logan, B.R., 2005. Complex fMRI analysis with unrestricted
	phase is equivalent to a magnitude-only model. NeuroImage 24 (2),
	603-606) generalized the model to have no restrictions on the phase
	time course. They showed that this unrestricted phase model was mathematically
	equivalent to the usual magnitude-only data model including regression
	coefficients and voxel activation statistic but philosophically different
	due to it derivation from complex data. Recent findings by (Hoogenrad,
	F.G., Reichenbach, J.R., Haacke, E.M., Lai, S., Kuppusamy, K., Sprenger,
	M., 1998. In vivo measurement of changes in venous blood-oxygenation

	BOLD signals in high-resolution fMRI. Magn. Reson. Med. 47 (1), 1-9)
	indicate that the voxel phase time course may exhibit task related
	changes. In this paper, a general complex fMRI activation model is
	introduced that describes both the magnitude and phase in complex
	data which can be used to specifically characterize task related
	change in both. Hypotheses regarding task related magnitude and/or
	phase changes are evaluated using derived activation statistics.
	It was found that the Rowe-Logan complex constant phase model strongly
	biases against voxels with task related phase changes and that the
	current very general complex linear phase model can be cast to address
	several different hypotheses sensitive to different magnitude/phase
	changes.},

  abstract = {**WHEN YOU KNOW A CULINARY RATIO, IT'S NOT LIKE KNOWING A SINGLE RECIPE,
	IT'S INSTANTLY KNOWING A THOUSAND.**
	
	 Why spend time sorting through the millions of cookie recipes available
	in books, magazines, and on the Internet? Isn't it easier just to
	remember 1-2-3? That's the ratio of ingredients that always make
	a basic, delicious cookie dough: 1 part sugar, 2 parts fat, and 3
	parts flour. From there, add anything you want -- chocolate, lemon
	and orange zest, nuts, poppy seeds, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, almond
	extract, or peanut butter, to name a few favorite additions. Replace
	white sugar with brown for a darker, chewier cookie. Add baking powder
	and/or eggs for a lighter, airier texture.**
	
	 RATIOS ARE THE STARTING POINT FROM WHICH A THOUSAND VARIATIONS BEGIN.**
	
	 Ratios are the simple proportions of one ingredient to another. Biscuit
	dough is 3 : 1 : 2 -- or 3 parts flour, 1 part fat, and 2 parts liquid.
	This ratio is the beginning of many variations, and because the biscuit
	takes sweet and savory flavors with equal grace, you can top it with
	whipped cream and strawberries or sausage gravy. Vinaigrette is 3
	: 1, or 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar, and is one of the most useful
	sauces imaginable, giving everything from grilled meats and fish
	to steamed vegetables or lettuces intense flavor.
	
	 Cooking with ratios will unchain you from recipes and set you free.
	With thirty-three ratios and suggestions for enticing variations,
	\_Ratio\_ is the truth ofcooking: basic preparations that teach us
	how the fundamental ingredients of the kitchen -- water, flour, butter
	and oils, milk and cream, and eggs -- work. Change the ratio and
	bread dough becomes pasta dough, cakes become muffins become popovers
	become crepes.
	
	 As the culinary world fills up with overly complicated recipes and
	never- ending ingredient lists, Michael Ruhlman blasts through the
	surplus of information and delivers this innovative, straightforward
	book that cuts to the core of cooking. \_Ratio\_ provides one of
	the greatest kitchen lessons there is -- and it makes the cooking
	easier and more satisfying than ever.},

	differences between brain functional magnetic resonance images (f{MRI}'s)
	acquired under two different experimental conditions. The method
	benefits from the fact that a smooth and spatially localized signal
	can be represented by a small set of localized wavelet coefficients,
	while the power of white noise is uniformly spread throughout the
	wavelet space. Hence, a statistical procedure is developed that uses
	the imposed decomposition orthogonality to locate wavelet-space partitions
	with large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and subsequently restricts
	the testing for significant wavelet coefficients to these partitions.
	This results in a higher SNR and a smaller number of statistical
	tests, yielding a lower detection threshold compared to spatial-domain
	testing and, thus, a higher detection sensitivity without increasing
	type I errors. The multiresolution approach of the wavelet method
	is particularly suited to applications where the signal bandwidth
	and/or the characteristics of an imaging modality cannot be well
	specified. The proposed method was applied to compare two different
	f{MRI} acquisition modalities. Differences of the respective useful
	signal bandwidths could be clearly demonstrated; the estimated signal,
	due to the smoothness of the wavelet representation, yielded more
	compact regions of neuroactivity than standard spatial-domain testing.},

  abstract = {Multivariate pattern recognition methods are increasingly being used
	to identify multiregional brain activity patterns that collectively
	discriminate one cognitive condition or experimental group from another,
	using fMRI data. The performance of these methods is often limited
	because the number of regions considered in the analysis of fMRI
	data is large compared to the number of observations (trials or participants).
	Existing methods that aim to tackle this dimensionality problem are
	less than optimal because they either over-fit the data or are computationally
	intractable. Here, we describe a novel method based on logistic regression
	using a combination of L1 and L2 norm regularization that more accurately
	estimates discriminative brain regions across multiple conditions
	or groups. The L1 norm, computed using a fast estimation procedure,
	ensures a fast, sparse and generalizable solution; the L2 norm ensures
	that correlated brain regions are included in the resulting solution,
	a critical aspect of fMRI data analysis often overlooked by existing
	methods. We first evaluate the performance of our method on simulated
	data and then examine its effectiveness in discriminating between
	well-matched music and speech stimuli. We also compared our procedures
	with other methods which use either L1-norm regularization alone
	or support vector machine-based feature elimination. On simulated
	data, our methods performed significantly better than existing methods
	across a wide range of contrast-to-noise ratios and feature prevalence
	rates. On experimental fMRI data, our methods were more effective
	in selectively isolating a distributed fronto-temporal network that
	distinguished between brain regions known to be involved in speech
	and music processing. These findings suggest that our method is not
	only computationally efficient, but it also achieves the twin objectives
	of identifying relevant discriminative brain regions and accurately
	classifying fMRI data.},

  abstract = {The recent development of 3 Tesla MRI (3T MRI) has been fueled by
	promise of increased signal-to-noise ratio(SNR). Many are excited
	about the opportunity to not only use the increased SNR for clearer
	images, but also the chance to exchange it for better resolution
	or faster scans. These possibilities have caused a rapid increase
	in the market for 3T MRI, where the faster scanning tips an already
	advantageous economic outlook in favor of the user. As a result,
	the global market for 3T has grown from a research only market just
	a few years ago to an ever-increasing clinically oriented customer
	base. There are, however, significant obstacles to 3T MRI presented
	by the physics at higher field strengths. For example, the T1 relaxation
	times are prolonged with increasing magnet field strength. Further,
	the increased RF-energy deposition (SAR), the larger the chemical
	shift and the stronger susceptibility effect have to be considered
	as challenges. It is critical that one looks at both the advantages
	and disadvantages of using 3T. While there are many issues to address
	aand a number of different methods for doing so, to properly tackle
	each of these concerns will take time and effort on the part od researchers
	and clinicians. The optimization of 3T MRI scanning will have to
	be a combined effort, though much of the work to date has been in
	neuroimaging. Multiple applications have been explored in addition
	to clinical anatomical imaging, where resolution is improved showing
	structure in the brain never seen before in human MRI. Body and cardiac
	imaging provide a great challenge but are also achievable at 3T.
	As an example, the full range of clinical applications currently
	achieved on today's state-of-the-art 1.5T cardiac MR scanners has
	also been demonstrated at 3T. In the body, the full range of contrast
	is available over large fields of view allowing whole liver studies
	in the clinic or, as needed, one may choose a smaller field of view
	for high-resolution imaging of the pancreas. The ability to increase
	resolution for musculoskeletal imaging has provided previously unseen
	detail. Bone structure, cartilage, and tendons and ligaments can
	be clearly visualized and pathology more easily detected due to an
	increased image quality. As the increase in field strength continues,
	a push to look at 7T has begun. The design philosophy is to keep
	the system as similar as possible, while changing only the frequency-dependent
	components. To date, both animal and human imaging have been performed
	on a whole body 7T scanner. Results show promise for both detailed
	imaging and functional MRI, but the road ahead is too long to be
	able to predict where it will end. The move toward higher field strengths
	is an exciting adventure in which 3T plays the role of trailblazer.},

	a set of forward-backward recursions calculating conditional distributions

	Most of the previous approaches have assumed that the noise variance

	that this assumption is unrealistic; f{MRI} parameter maps typically
	have more similarity to a 1/f-type spatial covariance with greater
	variance in 2D wavelet coefficients representing lower spatial frequencies,
	or coarser spatial features, in the maps. To address this issue we
	resample the f{MRI} time series data in the wavelet domain (using
	a 1D discrete wavelet transform [DWT]) to produce a set of permuted
	parametric maps that are decomposed (using a 2D DWT) to estimate
	level-specific variances of the 2D wavelet coefficients under the
	null hypothesis. These resampling-based estimates of the "wavelet
	variance spectrum" are substituted in a Bayesian bivariate shrinkage
	operator to denoise the observed 2D wavelet coefficients, which are
	then inverted to reconstitute the observed, denoised map in the spatial
	domain. Multiple hypothesis testing controlling the false discovery
	rate in the observed, denoised maps then proceeds in the spatial
	domain, using thresholds derived from an independent set of permuted,
	denoised maps. We show empirically that this more realistic, resampling-based
	algorithm for wavelet-based denoising and multiple hypothesis testing

	representation of quantities, the abstract processing of magnitudes
	and the relation between them. On the other hand, the angular gyrus
	takes part in the verbal processing of certain tasks called arithmetical

	correlated with the magnitude of activation in the left occipitotemporal
	region. Activation in the left and right inferior frontal gyri was
	greater in older compared with younger dyslexic children. CONCLUSIONS:
	These findings provide neurobiological evidence of an underlying
	disruption in the neural systems for reading in children with dyslexia
	and indicate that it is evident at a young age. The locus of the
	disruption places childhood dyslexia within the same neurobiological
	framework as dyslexia, and acquired alexia, occurring in adults.},

	optimally preserves the local functional coupling between f{MRI}

	on the graph. Because the commute time can be computed directly from
	the eigenvectors of (a symmetric version) the graph probability transition
	matrix, we use these eigenvectors to embed the dataset in low dimensions.
	After clustering the datasets in low dimensions, coherent structures
	emerge that can be easily interpreted. We performed an extensive

	level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (f{MRI}) signals in gray matter,
	excluding the confounding, inaccurate contributions of large blood
	vessels. We quantified the spatial specificity of the BOLD response,
	and we investigated whether this specificity varies as a function
	of time from stimulus onset. f{MRI} was performed at 7 Tesla (T),
	where mapping signals of parenchymal origin are easily detected.
	Two abutting visual stimuli were adjusted to elicit responses centered
	on a flat gray matter region in V1. f{MRI} signals were sampled at
	high-resolution orthogonal to the retinotopic boundary between the
	representations of the stimuli. Signals from macro-vessels were masked
	out. Principal component analysis revealed that the first component
	in space accounted for 96.2+/-1.6\% of the variance over time. The
	spatial profile of this time-invariant response was fitted with a
	model consisting of the convolution of a step function and a Gaussian
	point-spread-function (PSF). The mean full-width at half-maximal-height
	of the fitted PSF was 2.34+/-0.20 mm. Based on simulations of confounding
	effects, we estimate that BOLD PSF in human gray matter is smaller
	than 2 mm. A time-point to time-point analysis revealed that the
	PSF obtained during the 3rd (1.52 mm) and 4th (1.99 mm) seconds of
	stimulation were narrower than the mean PSF obtained from the 5th
	second on (2.42+/-0.15 mm). The position of the edge of the responding
	region was offset (1.72+/-0.07 mm) from the boundary of the stimulated
	region, indicating a spatial non-linearity. Simulations showed that
	the effective contrast between active and non-active columns is reduced
	25-fold when imaged using a PSF whose width is equal to the cycle
	of the imaged columnar organization. Thus, the PSF of the hyper-oxygenated
	BOLD response in human gray matter is narrower than that reported
	at 1.5 T, where macro-vessels dominate the mapping signals. The initial
	phase of this response is more spatially specific than later phases.
	Data acquisition methods that suppress macro-vascular signals should
	increase the spatial specificity of BOLD f{MRI}. The choice of optimal
	stimulus duration represents a trade-off between the spatial specificity
	and the overhead associated with short stimulus duration.},

  abstract = {Crame acute;r-Rao bounds on estimation accuracy are established for
	estimation problems on arbitrary manifolds in which no set of intrinsic
	coordinates exists. The frequently encountered examples of estimating
	either an unknown subspace or a covariance matrix are examined in
	detail. The set of subspaces, called the Grassmann manifold, and
	the set of covariance (positive-definite Hermitian) matrices have
	no fixed coordinate system associated with them and do not possess
	a vector space structure, both of which are required for deriving
	classical Crame acute;r-Rao bounds. Intrinsic versions of the Crame
	acute;r-Rao bound on manifolds utilizing an arbitrary affine connection
	with arbitrary geodesics are derived for both biased and unbiased
	estimators. In the example of covariance matrix estimation, closed-form
	expressions for both the intrinsic and flat bounds are derived and
	compared with the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the sample covariance
	matrix (SCM) estimator for varying sample support K. The accuracy
	bound on unbiased covariance matrix estimators is shown to be about
	(10/log 10)n/K12/ dB, where n is the matrix order. Remarkably, it
	is shown that from an intrinsic perspective, the SCM is a biased
	and inefficient estimator and that the bias term reveals the dependency
	of estimation accuracy on sample support observed in theory and practice.
	The RMSE of the standard method of estimating subspaces using the
	singular value decomposition (SVD) is compared with the intrinsic
	subspace Crame acute;r-Rao bound derived in closed form by varying
	both the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the unknown p-dimensional
	subspace and the sample support. In the simplest case, the Crame
	acute;r-Rao bound on subspace estimation accuracy is shown to be
	about (p(n-p))12-1/2/SNR-12/ rad for p-dimensional subspaces. It
	is seen that the SVD-based method yields accuracies very close to
	the Crame acute;r-Rao bound, establishing that the principal invariant
	subspace of a random sample provides an excellent estimator of an
	unknown subspace. The analysis approach developed is directly applicable
	to many other estimation problems on manifolds encountered in signal
	processing and elsewhere, such as estimating rotation matrices in
	computer vision a- nd estimating subspace basis vectors in blind
	source separation.},

	representation in DD, at least in the range of single-digit numbers.
	However, minor discrepancies between DD subjects and controls suggest

	data. We describe a particular realization of EDA, the three-stage
	strategy EROICA (Exploring Regions Of Interest with Cluster Analysis),
	specifically designed to analyze functional MR neuroimaging data.
	The first stage consists of an Initial Partition of the data into
	three groups: a group of "trend" time-courses (TCs), a group of "potentially
	interesting" TCs, and a group that contains the remaining, putative
	"noise" TCs. The initial grouping is achieved by first normalizing
	(scaling) the TCs, followed by selection procedures based on specific
	"trend" and "noise" tests. The second stage is the Principal Partition,
	where fuzzy clustering analysis (FCA) is applied to the group of
	"potentially interesting" TCs. The third stage, Significance Testing,
	"validates" the second-stage results by first removing those TCs
	from the original clusters that fail special statistical tests. and
	then by attempting to allocate to the clusters some of the initially
	excluded "trend" and "noise" TCs. We assessed the consequences of
	this three-stage strategy on the quality of the clustering results.
	We show that employing this strategy both improves results relative
	to clustering that did not use the initial partitioning, and also
	speeds up execution significantly. We report detailed analyses on
	several phantom datasets and on a multi-slice, real f{MRI} dataset.
	Based on detailed studies carried out on sixteen f{MRI} datasets,
	the execution time of EROICA scales sublinearly both with T (scans)
	and N (number of TCs). We propose robustness (noise resistance, reproducibility)
	flexibility/versatility, and speed as the three major requirements
	that any practically viable EDA method ought to satisfy. We show
	that the EROICA process, and EvIdent®, its software implementation,
	fulfill these requirements.},

	imaging, co-variance in signal intensity has been shown in functionally
	related regions of brain in participants instructed to perform no
	cognitive task. These changes are thought to represent synchronous
	fluctuations in blood flow, which imply neuronal connections between
	the regions. The purpose of this study was to map functional connectivity
	in subcortical nuclei with functional connectivity functional MR
	imaging. METHODS: Imaging data were acquired with an echo-planar
	sequence from six volunteers who performed no specific cognitive
	task. For functional connectivity functional MR imaging, a "seed"
	voxel or group of voxels was selected from the resting data set in
	the thalamus or in the hippocampus. Control voxels in gray matter
	presumed not to be eloquent cortex were also chosen. The correlation
	coefficient of the seed voxels and the control voxels with every
	other voxel in the resting data set was calculated. The voxels with
	correlation coefficients greater than or equal to 0.5 were mapped
	onto anatomic images for the functional connectivity functional MR
	images. The anatomic location of these voxels was determined by conventional
	parcellation methods. RESULTS: For each participant, functional connectivity
	functional MR imaging maps based on four seed voxels in the thalamus
	or hippocampus showed clusters of voxels in the ipsilateral and contralateral
	thalamus or hippocampus. For control voxels, few voxels in the hippocampus
	or thalamus showed significant correlation. Significantly more pixels
	in the ipsilateral hippocampus correlated with the seed voxel than
	in the contralateral hippocampus. The differences between numbers
	of functionally connected voxels in ipsilateral thalamus and those
	in contralateral thalamus were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The
	thalamus and hippocampus show functional connectivity, presumably

	This insight, which disciplines like physics have embraced for a
	long time already, is gradually gaining importance in the study of
	cognitive processes by functional neuroimaging. In this field, causal
	mechanisms in neural systems are described in terms of effective
	connectivity. Recently, dynamic causal modelling (DCM) was introduced
	as a generic method to estimate effective connectivity from neuroimaging
	data in a Bayesian fashion. One of the key advantages of DCM over
	previous methods is that it distinguishes between neural state equations
	and modality-specific forward models that translate neural activity
	into a measured signal. Another strength is its natural relation
	to Bayesian model selection (BMS) procedures. In this article, we
	review the conceptual and mathematical basis of DCM and its implementation
	for functional magnetic resonance imaging data and event-related
	potentials. After introducing the application of BMS in the context
	of DCM, we conclude with an outlook to future extensions of DCM.
	These extensions are guided by the long-term goal of using dynamic

  abstract = {Understanding the link between neurobiology and cognition requires
	that neuroscience moves beyond mere structure-function correlations.
	An explicit systems perspective is needed in which putative mechanisms
	of how brain function is constrained by brain structure are mathematically
	formalized and made accessible for experimental investigation. Such
	a systems approach critically rests on a better understanding of
	brain connectivity in its various forms. Since 2002, frontier topics
	of connectivity and neural system analysis have been discussed in
	a multidisciplinary annual meeting, the Brain Connectivity Workshop
	(BCW), bringing together experimentalists and theorists from various
	fields. This article summarizes some of the main discussions at the
	two most recent workshops, 2006 at Sendai, Japan, and 2007 at Barcelona,
	Spain: (i) investigation of cortical micro- and macrocircuits, (ii)
	models of neural dynamics at multiple scales, (iii) analysis of "resting
	state" networks, and (iv) linking anatomical to functional connectivity.
	Finally, we outline some central challenges and research trajectories
	in computational systems neuroscience for the next years.},

	simultaneously maximizes statistical independence over both time

	independence either over time only or over space only; these methods
	often yield physically improbable solutions. Second, skew-ICA is
	based on the assumption that images have skewed probability density

	it to analyze synthetic data and data from an event-related, left-right
	visual hemifield f{MRI} experiment. Results obtained with skew-stICA
	are superior to those of principal component analysis, spatial ICA

	provides an alternative to simulations and ROC curves by using real
	PET and f{MRI} data sets to examine the relationship between prediction

	We demonstrate the utility of this framework across the wide range
	of performance metrics obtained from [(15)O]water PET studies of
	12 age- and sex-matched data sets performing different motor tasks
	(8 subjects/set). For the 12 data sets we apply NPAIRS with both
	univariate and multivariate data-analysis approaches to: (1) demonstrate
	that this framework may be used to obtain reproducible SPMs from
	any data-analysis approach on a common Z-score scale (rSPM[Z]); (2)
	demonstrate that the histogram of a rSPM[Z] image may be modeled
	as the sum of a data-analysis-dependent noise distribution and a
	task-dependent, Gaussian signal distribution that scales monotonically
	with our reproducibility performance metric; (3) explore the relation
	between prediction and reproducibility performance metrics with an
	emphasis on bias-variance tradeoffs for flexible, multivariate models;

	engaged. The group-discriminating performance is evaluated on 15
	f{MRI} feature combinations (5 single features and 10 joint features)

	Results show that a feature from a sensorimotor task and a joint
	feature from a Sternberg working memory (probe) task and an auditory
	oddball (target) task are the top two feature combinations distinguishing
	groups. We identified three optimal features that best separate patients

	provide improved capability in classifying group membership. The

	no assumption is made on the data content itself, but the data structure

	we present an alternative that tries to take into account some relevant
	knowledge for the analysis of the dataset, e.g., the experimental
	paradigm, while keeping the flexibility of exploratory methods: we
	use a prior temporal modeling of the data that characterizes each

	a kernel PCA method that builds a redundant representation of the
	data through the nonlinearity of the kernel. This allows for a refinement
	in the description of the (temporal) patterns of interest. In particular,
	this helps in the characterization of subtle variations in the response

	An f{MRI} experimental paradigm which is well-suited for examination
	of effective connectivity is the slow event-related design. This
	design presents stimuli at sufficient temporal spacing for determining
	within-trial trajectories of BOLD activation, allowing for the analysis
	of stimulus-locked temporal covariation of brain responses in multiple
	regions. This may be especially important for emotional stimuli processing,
	which can evolve over the course of several seconds, if not longer.
	However, while several methods have been devised for determining
	f{MRI} effective connectivity, few are adapted to event-related designs,
	which include nonstationary BOLD responses and multiple levels of
	nesting. We propose a model tailored for exploring effective connectivity
	of multiple brain regions in event-related f{MRI} designs -- a semi-parametric
	adaptation of vector autoregressive (VAR) models, termed #stimulus-locked##VAR#
	(SloVAR). Connectivity coefficients vary as a function of time relative
	to stimulus onset, are regularized via basis expansions, and vary
	randomly across subjects. SloVAR obtains flexible, data-driven estimates
	of effective connectivity and hence is useful for building connectivity
	models when prior information on dynamic regional relationships is
	sparse. Indices derived from the coefficient estimates can also be
	used to relate effective connectivity estimates to behavioral or
	clinical measures. We demonstrate the SloVAR model on a sample of
	clinically depressed and normal controls, showing that early but
	not late cortico-amygdala connectivity appears crucial to emotional
	control and early but not late cortico-cortico connectivity predicts
	depression severity in the depressed group, relationships that would
	have been missed in a more traditional VAR analysis.},

  abstract = {Studies of the cerebral cortex, particularly those of the visual system,
	demonstrate the existence of multiple, anatomically segregated and
	functionally specialized cortical areas. There is no evidence that
	these areas, which are linked by a network of reciprocal connections,
	are coordinated by a higher-order center. The visual image that we
	perceive, however, seems to be unified and coherent. In this article,
	we address the problem of integration posed by these observations.
	In an extension of our previous work, we develop a dynamic model
	of reentry. Reentry is a process of parallel and recursive signaling
	along ordered anatomical connections that achieves integration by
	giving rise to constructive and correlative properties within and
	among maps. We present and test a computer model simulating nine
	functionally segregated visual areas organized into three streams
	for form, color, and motion. The model receives visual input consisting
	of camera images of objects of different shapes and colors. We show
	the specialized response properties of the areas in the three streams.
	A computational strategy involving a phase variable is introduced
	to represent explicitly the dynamics of short-term temporal correlations
	among thousands of units distributed across different areas. We then
	illustrate constructive and correlative consequences of reentry within
	a system of reciprocal intra- and interareal connections by two examples
	taken from psychophysics: generation of form from motion and motion
	capture. The model solves the so-called "binding problem" through
	short-term correlations, which serve to link similar object features
	within a simulated cortical area and to bind multiple attributes
	of one or more objects across several areas, including a nontopographic
	one. Integration emerges from cooperative effects within and among
	the specialized areas. These effects lead to a simple output, a simulated

	(BOLD) contrast localizes neuronal processing of cognitive paradigms.
	As magnetic resonance signal responses are small, functional mapping
	requires statistical analysis of temporally averaged image data.
	Although voxels activating at the paradigm frequency can be identified
	from the Fourier power spectrum, such analyses collapse the temporal
	information that is useful to establish consistency of responses
	during the paradigm. The design of a set of nonorthogonal wavelets
	of specified frequency resolution within the power spectrum was investigated
	for extracting desired frequency responses from the noisy signal
	intensity of individual voxels. These wavelets separate the low-frequency
	cognitive response to the paradigm from the respiratory and cardiac
	responses at higher frequencies. The retention of the temporal information,
	possible by wavelet analysis, allows the MR signal changes to be
	compared to changes in behavioral responses over the duration of
	an entire paradigm. The amplitude and time delay of the wavelet specified
	by the paradigm identify quantitatively the size of the MR signal
	change and the temporal delay of the hemodynamic BOLD response, respectively.
	This specified-resolution wavelet analysis was demonstrated for individual
	voxels and maps through the frontal eye fields using a visually guided
	saccade paradigm.},

  abstract = {Over the last 20-30 years, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has become
	the algorithm of choice in numerous nonlinear estimation and machine
	learning applications. These include estimating the state of a nonlinear
	dynamic system as well estimating parameters for nonlinear system
	identification (eg, learning the weights of a neural network). The
	EKF applies the standard linear Kalman filter methodology to a linearization
	of the true nonlinear system. This approach is sub-optimal, and can
	easily lead to divergence. Julier et al. (1997), proposed the unscented
	Kalman filter (UKF) as a derivative-free alternative to the extended
	Kalman filter in the framework of state estimation. This was extended
	to parameter estimation by Wan and Van der Merwe et al., (2000).
	The UKF consistently outperforms the EKF in terms of prediction and
	estimation error, at an equal computational complexity of (OL3)l
	for general state-space problems. When the EKF is applied to parameter
	estimation, the special form of the state-space equations allows
	for an O(L2) implementation. This paper introduces the square-root
	unscented Kalman filter (SR-UKF) which is also O(L3) for general
	state estimation and O(L2) for parameter estimation (note the original
	formulation of the UKF for parameter-estimation was O(L3)). In addition,

  abstract = {The brain is a complex dynamic system of functionally connected regions.
	Graph theory has been successfully used to describe the organization
	of such dynamic systems. Recent resting-state f{MRI} studies have
	suggested that inter-regional functional connectivity shows a small-world
	topology, indicating an organization of the brain in highly clustered
	sub-networks, combined with a high level of global connectivity.
	In addition, a few studies have investigated a possible scale-free
	topology of the human brain, but the results of these studies have
	been inconclusive. These studies have mainly focused on inter-regional
	connectivity, representing the brain as a network of brain regions,
	requiring an arbitrary definition of such regions. However, using
	a voxel-wise approach allows for the model-free examination of both
	inter-regional as well as intra-regional connectivity and might reveal
	new information on network organization. Especially, a voxel-based
	study could give information about a possible scale-free organization
	of functional connectivity in the human brain. Resting-state 3 Tesla
	f{MRI} recordings of 28 healthy subjects were acquired and individual
	connectivity graphs were formed out of all cortical and sub-cortical
	voxels with connections reflecting inter-voxel functional connectivity.
	Graph characteristics from these connectivity networks were computed.
	The clustering-coefficient of these networks turned out to be much
	higher than the clustering-coefficient of comparable random graphs,
	together with a short average path length, indicating a small-world
	organization. Furthermore, the connectivity distribution of the number
	of inter-voxel connections followed a power-law scaling with an exponent
	close to 2, suggesting a scale-free network topology. Our findings
	suggest a combined small-world and scale-free organization of the
	functionally connected human brain. The results are interpreted as
	evidence for a highly efficient organization of the functionally
	connected brain, in which voxels are mostly connected with their
	direct neighbors forming clustered sub-networks, which are held together
	by a small number of highly connected hub-voxels that ensure a high
	level of overall connectivity.},

	activity of spatially segregated regions, is being studied increasingly
	because it may determine the reaction of the brain to external stimuli
	and task requirements and it is reportedly altered in many neurological
	and psychiatric disorders. In functional magnetic resonance imaging
	(f{MRI}), such functional connectivity is investigated commonly by
	correlating the time course of a chosen "seed voxel" with the remaining
	voxel time courses in a voxel-by-voxel manner. This approach is biased
	by the actual choice of the seed voxel, however, because it only
	shows functional connectivity for the chosen brain region while ignoring
	other potentially interesting patterns of coactivation. We used spatial
	independent component analysis (sICA) to assess cortical functional
	connectivity maps from resting state data. SICA does not depend on
	any chosen temporal profile of local brain activity. We hypothesized
	that sICA would be able to find functionally connected brain regions
	within sensory and motor regions in the absence of task-related brain
	activity. We also investigated functional connectivity patterns of
	several parietal regions including the superior parietal cortex and
	the posterior cingulate gyrus. The components of interest were selected

	SICA yielded connectivity maps of bilateral auditory, motor and visual
	cortices. Moreover, it showed that prefrontal and parietal areas

  abstract = {Recently, we have introduced an integrated framework that combines
	wavelet-based processing with statistical testing in the spatial
	domain. In this paper, we propose two important enhancements of the
	framework. First, we revisit the underlying paradigm; i.e., that
	the effect of the wavelet processing can be considered as an adaptive
	denoising step to "improve" the parameter map, followed by a statistical
	detection procedure that takes into account the non-linear processing
	of the data. With an appropriate modification of the framework, we
	show that it is possible to reduce the spatial bias of the method
	with respect to the best linear estimate, providing conservative
	results that are closer to the original data. Second, we propose
	an extension of our earlier technique that compensates for the lack
	of shift-invariance of the wavelet transform. We demonstrate experimentally
	that both enhancements have a positive effect on performance. In
	particular, we present a reproducibility study for multi-session
	data that compares WSPM against SPM with different amounts of smoothing.
	The full approach is available as a toolbox, named WSPM, for the
	SPM2 software; it takes advantage of multiple options and features
	of SPM such as the general linear model.},

	levels known to induce profound loss of consciousness. We specifically
	demonstrate coherent spontaneous fluctuations within three well known
	systems (oculomotor, somatomotor and visual) and the 'default' system,
	a set of brain regions thought by some to support uniquely human
	capabilities. Our results indicate that coherent system fluctuations

  abstract = {Within-subject analysis in fMRI essentially addresses two problems,
	the detection of brain regions eliciting evoked activity and the
	estimation of the underlying dynamics. In Makni et aL, 2005 and Makni
	et aL, 2008, a detection-estimation framework has been proposed to
	tackle these problems jointly, since they are connected to one another.
	In the Bayesian formalism, detection is achieved by modeling activating
	and nonactivating voxels through independent mixture models (IMM)
	within each region while hemodynamic response estimation is performed
	at a regional scale in a nonparametric way. Instead of IMMs, in this
	paper we take advantage of spatial mixture models (SMM) for their
	nonlinear spatial regularizing properties. The proposed method is
	unsupervised and spatially adaptive in the sense that the amount
	of spatial correlation is automatically tuned from the data and this
	setting automatically varies across brain regions. In addition, the
	level of regularization is specific to each experimental condition
	since both the signal-to-noise ratio and the activation pattern may
	vary across stimulus types in a given brain region. These aspects
	require the precise estimation of multiple partition functions of
	underlying Ising fields. This is addressed efficiently using first
	path sampling for a small subset of fields and then using a recently
	developed fast extrapolation technique for the large remaining set.
	Simulation results emphasize that detection relying on supervised
	SMM outperforms its IMM counterpart and that unsupervised spatial
	mixture models achieve similar results without any hand-tuning of
	the correlation parameter. On real datasets, the gain is illustrated
	in a localizer fMRI experiment: brain activations appear more spatially
	resolved using SMM in comparison with classical general linear model
	(GLM)-based approaches, while estimating a specific parcel-based
	HRF shape. Our approach therefore validates the treatment of unsmoothed
	fMRI data without fixed GLM def- - inition at the subject level and
	makes also the classical strategy of spatial Gaussian filtering deprecated.},

  title = {Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Gibbs Sampling},
  year = {2004},
  abstract = {A major limitation towards more widespread implementation of Bayesian
	approaches is that obtaining the posterior distribution often requires
	the integration of high-dimensional functions. This can be computationally
	very difficult, but several approaches short of direct integration
	have been proposed (reviewed by Smith 1991, Evans and Swartz 1995,
	Tanner 1996). We focus here on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods,
	which attempt to simulate direct draws from some complex distribution
	of interest. MCMC approaches are so-named because one uses the previous
	sample values to randomly generate the next sample value, generating
	a Markov chain (as the transition probabilities between sample values
	are only a function of the most recent sample value). The realization
	in the early 1990's (Gelfand and Smith 1990) that one particular
	MCMC method, the Gibbs sampler, is very widely applicable to a broad
	class of Bayesian problems has sparked a major increase in the application
	of Bayesian analysis, and this interest is likely to continue expanding
	for sometime to come. MCMC methods have their roots in the Metropolis
	algorithm (Metropolis and Ulam 1949, Metropolis et al. 1953), an
	attempt by physicists to compute complex integrals by expressing
	them as expectations for some distribution and then estimate this
	expectation by drawing samples from that distribution. The Gibbs
	sampler (Geman and Geman 1984) has its origins in image processing.
	It is thus somewhat ironic that the powerful machinery of MCMC methods
	had essentially no impact on the field of statistics until rather
	recently. Excellent (and detailed) treatments of MCMC methods are
	found in Tanner (1996) and Chapter two of Draper (2000). Additional
	references are given in the particular sections below. MONTE CARLO

	and structural brain networks that are constructed based on different
	parcellation approaches. However, one fundamental but vital issue
	of the impact of different brain parcellation schemes on the network
	topological architecture remains unclear. Here, we used resting-state
	functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate the influences of different
	brain parcellation atlases on the topological organization of brain
	functional networks. Whole-brain fMRI data were divided into ninety
	and seventy regions of interest according to two predefined anatomical
	atlases, respectively. Brain functional networks were constructed
	by thresholding the correlation matrices among the parcellated regions
	and further analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Both atlas-based
	brain functional networks were found to show robust small-world properties
	and truncated power-law connectivity degree distributions, which
	are consistent with previous brain functional and structural networks
	studies. However, more importantly, we found that there were significant
	differences in multiple topological parameters (e.g., small-worldness
	and degree distribution) between the two groups of brain functional
	networks derived from the two atlases. This study provides quantitative
	evidence on how the topological organization of brain networks is
	affected by the different parcellation strategies applied.},

  number = {3},
  abstract = {The hypothesis-driven f{MRI} data analysis methods, represented by
	the conventional general linear model (GLM), have a strictly defined
	statistical framework for assessing regionally specific activations
	but require prior brain response modeling that is usually hard to
	be accurate. On the contrary, exploratory methods, like the support
	vector machine (SVM), are independent of prior hemodynamic response
	function (HRF), but generally lack a statistical inference framework.
	To take the advantages of both kinds of methods, this paper presents
	a composite approach through combining conventional GLM with SVM.
	This hybrid SVM-GLM concept is to use the power of SVM to obtain
	a data-derived reference function and enter it into the conventional
	GLM for statistical inference. The data-derived reference function
	was extracted from the SVM classifier using a new temporal profile
	extraction method. In simulations with synthetic f{MRI} data, SVM-GLM
	demonstrated a better sensitivity and specificity performance for
	detecting the synthetic activations, as compared to the conventional
	GLM. With real f{MRI} data, SVM-GLM showed better sensitivity than
	regular GLM for detecting the sensorimotor activations.},

  abstract = {To explore the multivariate nature of f{MRI} data and to consider

	brain response model-free method is fundamentally required. Two such
	methods are presented in this paper by integrating a machine learning
	algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM), and the random effect
	model. Without any brain response modeling, SVM was used to extract
	a whole brain spatial discriminance map (SDM), representing the brain
	response difference between the contrasted experimental conditions.
	Population inference was then obtained through the random effect
	analysis (RFX) or permutation testing (PMU) on the individual subjects'
	SDMs. Applied to arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion f{MRI} data,
	SDM RFX yielded lower false-positive rates in the null hypothesis
	test and higher detection sensitivity for synthetic activations with
	varying cluster size and activation strengths, compared to the univariate
	general linear model (GLM)-based RFX. For a sensory-motor ASL f{MRI}
	study, both SDM RFX and SDM PMU yielded similar activation patterns
	to GLM RFX and GLM PMU, respectively, but with higher t values and
	cluster extensions at the same significance level. Capitalizing on
	the absence of temporal noise correlation in ASL data, this study
	also incorporated PMU in the individual-level GLM and SVM analyses
	accompanied by group-level analysis through RFX or group-level PMU.
	Providing inferences on the probability of being activated or deactivated
	at each voxel, these individual-level PMU-based group analysis methods
	can be used to threshold the analysis results of GLM RFX, SDM RFX

	underwent f{MRI} examinations in a 1.5T Philips Gyroscan ACS-NT {MRI}
	scanner. While wearing a contact glove, subjects executed a complex
	automated sequence of finger movements either spontaneously or in
	response to external auditory cues. Based on the result of a functional
	scout scan, a single slice that included the {M}1 and the {SMA} was
	selected for image acquisition (echo planar imaging, repetition time
	100 ms, echo time 50 ms, 64 x 64 matrix, 1,000 images). Data were
	analyzed with a shifting cross-correlation approach using the STIMULATE
	program and in-house programs written in Interactive Data Language
	(IDL(TM)). Time-course data were generated for regions of interest
	in the M1 as well as in the rostral and caudal SMA. Mean time between
	onset of the finger movement sequence and half-maximum of the signal
	change in {M}1 was 3.6 s for the externally cued execution (SD 0.5)
	and 3.5 s for the spontaneous execution (SD 0.6). Activation in the
	rostral section of the {SMA} occurred 0.7 s earlier than it did in
	the {M}1 during the externally cued execution and 2.0 s earlier during
	the spontaneous execution, a difference significant at the P < 0.01
	level. Our results indicate that rostral {SMA} activation precedes
	{M}1 activation by varying time intervals in the sub-second range
	that are determined by the mode of movement initialization. By applying
	a paradigm that exerts a differential influence on temporal activation,
	we could ensure that the observed timing differences were not the
	result of differences in hemodynamic response function.},

  abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (f{MRI}) is most commonly based
	on echo-planar imaging (EPI). With higher field strengths, gradient
	performance, and computational power, real-time f{MRI} has become
	feasible; that is, brain activation can be monitored during the ongoing
	scan. However, EPI suffers from geometric distortions due to inhomogeneities
	of the magnetic field, especially close to air-tissue interfaces.
	Thus, functional activations might be mislocalized and assigned to
	the wrong anatomical structures. Several techniques have been reported
	which reduce geometric distortions, for example, mapping of the static
	magnetic field B(0) or the point spread function for all voxels.
	Yet these techniques require additional reference scans and in some
	cases extensive computational time. Moreover, only static field inhomogeneities
	can be corrected, because the correction is based on a static reference
	scan. We present an approach which allows for simultaneous acquisition
	and distortion correction of a functional image without a reference
	scan. The technique is based on a modified multi-echo EPI data acquisition
	scheme using a phase-encoding (PE) gradient with alternating polarity.
	The images exhibit opposite distortions due to the inverted PE gradient.
	After adjusting the contrast of the images acquired at different
	echo times, this information is used for the distortion correction.
	We present the theory, implementation, and applications of this single-shot
	distortion correction. Significant reduction in geometric distortion
	is shown both for phantom images and human f{MRI} data. Moreover,
	sensitivity to the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) effect is
	increased by weighted summation of the undistorted images.},

	smoothing, the traditional denoising method used in f{MRI} analysis.
	One-dimensional WaveLab thresholding routines were adapted to two-dimensional
	(2-D) images, and applied to 2-D wavelet coefficients. To test the
	effect of these methods on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we compared
	the SNR of 2-D f{MRI} images before and after denoising, using both
	Gaussian smoothing and wavelet-based methods. We simulated a f{MRI}
	series with a time signal in an active spot, and tested the methods
	on noisy copies of it. The denoising methods were evaluated in two
	ways: by the average temporal SNR inside the original activated spot,
	and by the shape of the spot detected by thresholding the temporal
	SNR maps. Denoising methods that introduce much smoothness are better
	suited for low SNRs, but for images of reasonable quality they are
	not preferable, because they introduce heavy deformations. Wavelet-based
	denoising methods that introduce less smoothing preserve the sharpness
	of the images and retain the original shapes of active regions. We
	also performed statistical parametric mapping on the denoised simulated
	time series, as well as on a real f{MRI} data set. False discovery
	rate control was used to correct for multiple comparisons. The results
	show that the methods that produce smooth images introduce more false
	positives. The less smoothing wavelet-based methods, although generating
	more false negatives, produce a smaller total number of errors than
	Gaussian smoothing or wavelet-based methods with a large smoothing
	effect.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We present a simple, data-driven method to extract haemodynamic
	response functions (HRF) from functional magnetic resonance imaging
	(f{MRI}) time series, based on the Fourier-wavelet regularised deconvolution
	(ForWaRD) technique. HRF data are required for many f{MRI} applications,
	such as defining region-specific HRFs, effciently representing a
	general HRF, or comparing subject-specific HRFs. RESULTS: ForWaRD
	is applied to f{MRI} time signals, after removing low-frequency trends
	by a wavelet-based method, and the output of ForWaRD is a time series
	of volumes, containing the HRF in each voxel. Compared to more complex
	methods, this extraction algorithm requires few assumptions (separability
	of signal and noise in the frequency and wavelet domains and the
	general linear model) and it is fast (HRF extraction from a single
	f{MRI} data set takes about the same time as spatial resampling).
	The extraction method is tested on simulated event-related activation
	signals, contaminated with noise from a time series of real MRI images.
	An application for HRF data is demonstrated in a simple event-related
	experiment: data are extracted from a region with significant effects
	of interest in a first time series. A continuous-time HRF is obtained
	by fitting a nonlinear function to the discrete HRF coeffcients,
	and is then used to analyse a later time series. CONCLUSION: With
	the parameters used in this paper, the extraction method presented
	here is very robust to changes in signal properties. Comparison of
	analyses with fitted HRFs and with a canonical HRF shows that a subject-specific,
	regional HRF significantly improves detection power. Sensitivity
	and specificity increase not only in the region from which the HRFs
	are extracted, but also in other regions of interest.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We describe Support Vector Machine (SVM) applications
	to classification and clustering of channel current data. SVMs are
	variational-calculus based methods that are constrained to have structural
	risk minimization (SRM), i.e., they provide noise tolerant solutions
	for pattern recognition. The SVM approach encapsulates a significant
	amount of model-fitting information in the choice of its kernel.
	In work thus far, novel, information-theoretic, kernels have been
	successfully employed for notably better performance over standard
	kernels. Currently there are two approaches for implementing multiclass
	SVMs. One is called external multi-class that arranges several binary
	classifiers as a decision tree such that they perform a single-class
	decision making function, with each leaf corresponding to a unique
	class. The second approach, namely internal-multiclass, involves
	solving a single optimization problem corresponding to the entire
	data set (with multiple hyperplanes). RESULTS: Each SVM approach
	encapsulates a significant amount of model-fitting information in
	its choice of kernel. In work thus far, novel, information-theoretic,
	kernels were successfully employed for notably better performance
	over standard kernels. Two SVM approaches to multiclass discrimination
	are described: (1) internal multiclass (with a single optimization),
	and (2) external multiclass (using an optimized decision tree). We
	describe benefits of the internal-SVM approach, along with further
	refinements to the internal-multiclass SVM algorithms that offer
	significant improvement in training time without sacrificing accuracy.
	In situations where the data isn't clearly separable, making for
	poor discrimination, signal clustering is used to provide robust
	and useful information--to this end, novel, SVM-based clustering
	methods are also described. As with the classification, there are

	despite large differences in static tissue contrast. Two major sources
	of systematic error in the perfusion measurement are identified:
	the transit delay from the tagging region to the imaging slice; and
	the inclusion of intravascular tagged signal. A modified technique
	called QUIPSS II is described that decreases sensitivity to these

	With appropriate saturation pulses the pulse sequence can be arranged

	reveal differences in spatial location and dynamics that may be useful

	Within the same full model, we also investigate the variation of

	the use of automatic relevance determination priors to force certain

	or shape of stimulus response. Its main feature is a Canonical Variates
	Analysis (CVA) of the estimated effects of the predictors from a
	multivariate linear model (MLM). The advantage of this over current
	methods is that temporal correlations can be incorporated into the
	model, making the MLM method suitable for f{MRI} as well as PET data.
	Moreover, tests for the presence of any correlation, and inference
	about the number of canonical variates needed to capture that correlation,
	can be based on standard multivariate statistics, rather than simulations.
	When applied to an f{MRI} data set previously analyzed by another
	CVA method, the MLM method reveals a pattern of responses that is
	closer to that detected in an earlier non-CVA analysis.},

  abstract = {The Hahn spin-echo (HSE)-based BOLD effect at high magnetic fields
	is expected to provide functional images that originate exclusively
	from the microvasculature. The blood contribution that dominates
	HSE BOLD contrast at low magnetic fields (e.g., 1.5 T), and degrades
	specificity, is highly attenuated at high fields because the apparent
	T(2) of venous blood in an HSE experiment decreases quadratically
	with increasing magnetic field. In contrast, the HSE BOLD contrast
	is believed to arise from the microvasculature and increase supralinearly
	with the magnetic field strength. In this work we report the results
	of detailed and quantitative evaluations of HSE BOLD signal changes
	for functional imaging in the human visual cortex at 4 and 7 T. This
	study used high spatial resolution, afforded by the increased signal-to-noise
	ratio (SNR) of higher field strengths and surface coils, to avoid
	partial volume effects (PVEs), and demonstrated increased contrast-to-noise
	ratio (CNR) and spatial specificity at the higher field strengths.
	The HSE BOLD signal changes induced by visual stimulation were predominantly
	linearly dependent on the echo time (TE). They increased in magnitude
	almost quadratically in going from 4 to 7 T when the blood contribution
	was suppressed using Stejskal-Tanner gradients that suppress signals
	from the blood due to its inhomogeneous flow and higher diffusion
	constant relative to tissue. The HSE signal changes at 7 T were modeled
	accurately using a vascular volume of 1.5\%, in agreement with the
	capillary volume of gray matter. Furthermore, high-resolution acquisitions
	indicate that CNR increased with voxel sizes < 1 mm(3) due to diminishing
	white matter or cerebrospinal fluid-space vs. gray matter PVEs. It
	was concluded that the high-field HSE functional MRI (f{MRI}) signals
	originated largely from the capillaries, and that the magnitude of
	the signal changes associated with brain function reached sufficiently
	high levels at 7 T to make it a useful approach for mapping on the

	f{MRI} can noninvasively map the spatial architecture of brain function
	via localized increases in blood flow after sensory or cognitive
	stimulation. Recent advances in f{MRI} have led to enhanced sensitivity
	and spatial accuracy of the measured signals, indicating the possibility
	of detecting small neuronal ensembles that constitute fundamental
	computational units in the brain, such as cortical columns. Orientation
	columns in visual cortex are perhaps the best known example of such
	a functional organization in the brain. They cannot be discerned
	via anatomical characteristics, as with ocular dominance columns.
	Instead, the elucidation of their organization requires functional
	imaging methods. However, because of insufficient sensitivity, spatial
	accuracy, and image resolution of the available mapping techniques,
	thus far, they have not been detected in humans. Here, we demonstrate,
	by using high-field (7-T) f{MRI}, the existence and spatial features
	of orientation- selective columns in humans. Striking similarities
	were found with the known spatial features of these columns in monkeys.
	In addition, we found that a larger number of orientation columns
	are devoted to processing orientations around 90 degrees (vertical
	stimuli with horizontal motion), whereas relatively similar f{MRI}
	signal changes were observed across any given active column. With
	the current proliferation of high-field MRI systems and constant
	evolution of f{MRI} techniques, this study heralds the exciting prospect
	of exploring unmapped and/or unknown columnar level functional organizations

	of such modular organization, and have been studied extensively in
	anatomical and physiological experiments in rats, cats and monkeys.
	The importance of noninvasive study of such structures, in particular

	many attempts were made to map cortical columns using functional

	Spin-Echo (HSE) BOLD to map the ocular dominance columns (ODCs) of
	the human visual cortex reproducibly over several days with a high
	degree of accuracy, relative to expected spatial patterns from post-mortem

	and vascular structure in order to avoid confounding large vessel
	effects) to map unknown columnar systems in the human brain, potentially
	paving the way both for the study of the functional architecture

  abstract = {Recent studies have used pattern classification algorithms to predict
	or decode task parameters from individual f{MRI} activity patterns.
	For f{MRI} decoding, it is important to choose an appropriate set
	of voxels (or features) as inputs to the decoder, since the presence
	of many irrelevant voxels could lead to poor generalization performance,
	a problem known as overfitting. Although individual voxels could
	be chosen based on univariate statistics, the resulting set of voxels
	could be suboptimal if correlations among voxels carry important
	information. Here, we propose a novel linear classification algorithm,
	called sparse logistic regression (SLR), that automatically selects
	relevant voxels while estimating their weight parameters for classification.
	Using simulation data, we confirmed that SLR can automatically remove
	irrelevant voxels and thereby attain higher classification performance
	than other methods in the presence of many irrelevant voxels. SLR
	also proved effective with real f{MRI} data obtained from two visual
	experiments, successfully identifying voxels in corresponding locations
	of visual cortex. SLR-selected voxels often led to better performance
	than those selected based on univariate statistics, by exploiting
	correlated noise among voxels to allow for better pattern separation.
	We conclude that SLR provides a robust method for f{MRI} decoding
	and can also serve as a stand-alone tool for voxel selection.},

  abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is a data-driven approach that
	has exhibited great utility for functional magnetic resonance imaging
	(f{MRI}). Standard ICA implementations, however, do not provide the

	Averaging Independent Component Analysis by Reproducibility), is
	introduced to address these issues for spatial ICA applied to f{MRI}.
	RAICAR utilizes repeated ICA realizations and relies on the reproducibility
	between them to rank and select components. Different realizations
	are aligned based on correlations, leading to aligned components.
	Each component is ranked and thresholded based on between-realization
	correlations. Furthermore, different realizations of each aligned
	component are selectively averaged to generate the final estimate

	with the experimental protocol signal--has been extensively used
	for the identification of active regions in the brain. Both approaches
	have drawbacks; clustering of the time series themselves may identify
	voxels with similar temporal behavior that is unrelated to the stimulus,

	not suffer from the deficits associated with previous clustering
	methods. We first formalize the traditional classification methods
	as three steps: feature extraction, choice of classification metric
	and choice of classification algorithm. The use of different characteristics
	to effect the clustering (cross-correlation, autocorrelation, and
	so forth) relates to the first of these three steps. We then demonstrate
	the efficacy of autocorrelation clustering on a simple visual task
	and on resting data. A byproduct of our analysis is the finding that
	masking prior to clustering, as is commonly done, may degrade the
	quality of the discovered clusters, and we offer an explanation for
	this phenomenon.},

  abstract = {The relationship between the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD)
	signal and its underlying neuronal activity is still inconclusive.
	The task of completely understanding this relationship has been encumbered
	not only by the complexity of neuronal responses, but also by nonlinear
	characteristics of the vascular response that are not correlated
	to neural activity. Repeated stimuli inducing replicable neural responses
	led to successively smaller BOLD amplitudes and delayed BOLD onset
	latencies when inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) are shorter than 4-6
	s, indicating significant nonlinearity between the BOLD signal and
	the underlying neuronal activity. We have provided evidence that
	large-vessel BOLD contributions could be the source of the nonlinearity
	(Zhang, N., Zhu, X.H., Chen, W., 2008b. Investigating the source
	of BOLD nonlinearity in human visual cortex in response to paired
	visual stimuli. Neuroimage 43, 204-212). By utilizing the spin-echo
	(SE) BOLD f{MRI} method at high magnetic fields to suppress large-vessel
	BOLD contributions, we found that the BOLD signal from the micro-vascular
	activity is replicable in response to replicated neuronal activities
	even at ISIs as short as approximately 1 s, suggesting that the micro-vascular
	BOLD activity is essentially a linear system. These results indicate
	that micro-vascular BOLD signals should provide an accurate estimate
	of the amplitude of neuronal activity changes. Consequently, the
	findings are important in understanding and resolving the controversy
	in the neurovascular coupling relationship. In addition, the difference
	in BOLD response times between macro- and micro-vascular activities
	demonstrated herein will have a significant impact on functional
	connectivity and causality studies. Moreover, SE f{MRI} at high fields,
	due to its capability of accurately representing the strength of
	neural activity as well as its previously shown high spatial specificity
	to activated brain regions, is an ideal choice for mapping brain
	function and quantifying the stimulus-evoked brain activity noninvasively.},

  abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for
	statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images
	because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant
	nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based
	model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information
	is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined
	images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not
	the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias
	field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
	produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden
	Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated
	by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which
	can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically,
	it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the
	HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way
	in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences
	of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in
	MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods
	are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based
	approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show
	that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into
	a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved.
	More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with
	other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction
	algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into
	this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach
	for brain MR image segmentation.},

	MRI image was replicated 150 times to simulate an f{MRI} time series.
	An event-related brain activation pattern with five different levels
	of intensity and Gaussian noise was superimposed on these images.
	Maximum contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the signal change ranged
	from 1.0 to 2.0 by 0.25 increments. In vivo visual stimulation f{MRI}
	experiments were performed on a 1.9 T magnet. Six human volunteers
	participated in this study. All imaging data were analyzed using
	both TCA and ICA methods. RESULTS: Both simulated and in vivo data
	have shown that no statistically significant difference exists in
	the activation areas detected by both ICA and TCA techniques when
	CNR of f{MRI} signal is larger than 1.75. CONCLUSION: TCA and ICA
	techniques are comparable in generating functional brain maps in
	event-related f{MRI} experiments. Although ICA has richer features
	in exploring the spatial and temporal information of the functional
	images, the TCA method has advantages in its computational efficiency,
	repeatability, and readiness to average data from group subjects},

	of effective connectivity among brain regions involved in a functional
	MR experiment. The approach is exploratory in the sense that it does
	not require an a priori model as in the earlier approaches, such
	as the Structural Equation Modeling or Dynamic Causal Modeling, which
	can only affirm or refute the connectivity of a previously known
	anatomical model or a hypothesized model. The conditional probabilities
	that render the interactions among brain regions in Bayesian networks
	represent the connectivity in the complete statistical sense. The

	in the cognitive network is large or unknown. We demonstrate the

	in silent word reading and counting Stroop tasks.},

	a single larger (e.g. birdcage) coil. With an array of small receive
	coils, image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be optimized throughout
	the field-of-view and the image acquisition process can be accelerated
	by use of parallel imaging (PI) techniques. In an accelerated PI
	experiment, data are undersampled during acquisition. Subsequently,
	artifact-free images are reconstructed based on the independently
	acquired signals from the elements of the receive coil array. PI
	techniques have recently been applied to functional MRI (f{MRI})
	experiments of the human brain in order to improve the performance

	distortions due to off-resonance signals, the reduction of signal-loss
	in areas with substantial signal inhomogeneity, increases of the
	spatial and temporal resolution of the f{MRI} experiment and reduction
	of gradient acoustic noise. Although the loss in SNR, inherent to
	PI, can severely compromise MRI image quality, the effect on f{MRI}
	quality, which is governed by the temporal stability of the signal,
	is often not as severe. On the other hand, PI's potential in mitigating
	the often severe image artifacts present in single-shot f{MRI} render
